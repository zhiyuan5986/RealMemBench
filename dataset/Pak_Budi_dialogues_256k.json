Technical analysis: Studying past market data, primarily price and volume, to identify trading opportunities.\nStrategies:\n1. Trend following: Identifying and trading in the direction of the overall market trend.\n2. Mean reversion: Taking advantage of temporary market imbalances by buying undervalued securities and selling overvalued ones.\n3. Breakout trading: Entering a trade when the price of a security breaks through a significant level of resistance or support.\nTechnical Analysis Tools:\n1. Moving Averages: Averaging past prices over a specified time period to identify trends and potential entry/exit points.\n2. Bollinger Bands: A volatility indicator that uses moving averages to form an upper and lower band around the price.\n3. Relative Strength Index (RSI): An oscillator that measures the strength of a security's price action, helping traders identify overbought and oversold conditions.\nIt's important to note that no single approach or tool is guaranteed to be successful and traders should always employ a comprehensive and diversified approach to their trading activities.

You're already an expert at getting things from point A to point B efficiently.\n    *   **Potential benefits:** Often offers a more stable income with fixed salaries or consistent delivery volumes compared to freelance ride-hailing, and sometimes benefits like health insurance.\n\n2.  **Bus or Minibus Driver (e.g., TransJakarta feeder, school bus, shuttle services):**\n    *   **How your skills apply:** Your safe driving record, strong sense of punctuality, time management, and ability to navigate busy city streets are crucial here. Your customer service skills would also be valuable in interacting with passengers.\n    *   **Potential benefits:** Generally provides a stable job with regular hours and a fixed salary.

It often comes with a higher level of respect and trust.\n\n4.  **Fleet Maintenance Assistant or Vehicle Inspector:**\n    *   **How your skills apply:** Your basic vehicle maintenance skills (checking tires, oil, fixing small things) could be a starting point. Your deep understanding of how vehicles operate daily and what issues arise could be very valuable in a garage or transport company.\n    *   **Potential benefits:** This could be a pathway into a more technical role, potentially leading to becoming a full mechanic with further training.

The module provides functions to read and write audio data from and to WAV files, respectively.\nHere is an example of how to use the `wavfile` module to read an audio file:\n```python\nfrom scipy.io import wavfile\n# Load the audio file\nsampling_rate, audio_data = wavfile.read('audio_file.wav')\n# Print the audio file's sampling rate\nprint('Sampling rate:', sampling_rate)\n# Print the audio file's shape\nprint('Shape of audio data:', audio_data.shape)\n```\nIn this example, `wavfile.read()` is used to load an audio file in WAV format. The function returns the audio data as a NumPy array and the sampling rate of the audio data. The sampling rate is the number of samples taken per second, and it is an important parameter when working with audio data.\nOnce the audio file is loaded, we can perform various operations on the audio data, such as processing, analysis, or playing the audio. We can also use the `wavfile` module to write the audio data to a new WAV file:\n```python\nfrom scipy.io import wavfile\n# Load the audio file\nsampling_rate, audio_data = wavfile.read('audio_file.wav')\n# Change the audio data in some way\n# ...\n# Write the modified audio data to a new file\nwavfile.write('modified_audio_file.wav', sampling_rate, audio_data)\n```\nIn this example, `wavfile.write()` is used to write the modified audio data to a new WAV file. The function takes the sampling rate and the audio data as input arguments, along with the file path where the new WAV file should be saved.\nOverall, the `wavfile` module in `scipy.io` provides a convenient way to work with audio data in WAV format.",

Ini beberapa gerakan peregangan dan tips posisi duduk yang gampang dan cepat, bisa langsung Anda coba saat menunggu orderan atau istirahat sebentar:\n\n### Gerakan Peregangan Cepat (Bisa Dilakukan di Pinggir Jalan atau Saat Berdiri)\n\n1.  **Regangan Punggung Bawah (Berdiri)**\n    *   **Cara:** Berdiri tegak, letakkan kedua tangan di pinggang (jari-jari menghadap ke bawah). Perlahan dorong pinggul sedikit ke depan sambil melengkungkan punggung ke belakang. Tahan 5-10 detik.\n    *   **Manfaat:** Meringankan ketegangan di punggung bawah akibat duduk lama.\n\n2.  **Regangan Leher dan Bahu (Berdiri atau Duduk)**\n    *   **Cara:**\n        *   **Leher:** Miringkan kepala perlahan ke satu sisi (misal telinga kanan mendekati bahu kanan), tahan 5 detik. Ulangi ke sisi lain.\n        *   **Bahu:** Angkat bahu ke arah telinga, tahan 3 detik, lalu jatuhkan. Ulangi 3-5 kali. Putar bahu ke belakang beberapa kali, lalu ke depan.\n    *   **Manfaat:** Mengurangi kekakuan di leher dan bahu yang sering tegang saat mengemudi.\n\n3.  **Putar Batang Tubuh (Berdiri atau Duduk)**\n    *   **Cara:**\n        *   **Berdiri:** Berdiri tegak, kaki selebar bahu. Putar tubuh bagian atas perlahan ke kanan, lalu ke kiri. Lakukan dengan lembut, jangan dipaksakan.\n        *   **Duduk:** Duduk tegak, putar tubuh bagian atas ke kanan, gunakan tangan kiri untuk memegang paha kanan sebagai penopang. Tahan 5-10 detik. Ulangi ke sisi lain.\n    *   **Manfaat:** Melenturkan tulang belakang dan mengurangi kekakuan.\n\n### Tips Posisi Duduk yang Benar (Saat Mengemudi atau Menunggu)\n\n1.  **Punggung Lurus dan Menempel Kursi:**\n    *   **Cara:** Pastikan punggung Anda menempel penuh pada sandaran kursi. Jangan membungkuk atau terlalu condong ke depan.\n    *   **Manfaat:** Mendukung alami lengkungan tulang belakang Anda. Jika ada bantal kecil untuk punggung bawah (lumbar support), itu akan sangat membantu.\n\n2.  **Kaki dan Lutut Fleksibel:**\n    *   **Cara:** Pastikan lutut sedikit menekuk dan tidak lurus sepenuhnya. Kaki Anda harus bisa mencapai pedal dengan nyaman tanpa meregangkan tubuh.\n    *   **Manfaat:** Mencegah ketegangan pada paha dan punggung bawah.\n\n3.  **Tangan Santai di Setir:**\n    *   **Cara:** Atur jarak kursi agar tangan Anda bisa memegang setir dengan siku sedikit menekuk, tidak lurus kaku.

Even small adjustments can make a big difference:\n\n1.  **Check Your Driving Posture:** Ensure your seat is adjusted so your back is fully supported, your knees are slightly bent, and your hands comfortably reach the steering wheel. A small cushion for lumbar support can also be very helpful.\n2.  **Take Micro-Breaks:** Whenever you're waiting for an order or during a short stop, try to get out of your vehicle, even for just 1-2 minutes. Stand up, stretch your back, roll your shoulders, and walk a few steps.

However, all CNN models occasionally displayed inconsistent classification for adjacent frames identified by expert curators as nearly identical, highlighting a lack of temporal consistency. To some degree this is expected because the CNN models have no or very little temporal information. On the other hand, because these frames are nearly identical to the human eye, this failure is more indicative of a lack of overall generalizability largely independent of time. These observations highlight the utility of temporal consistency in building models that can generalize well to a variety of scenarios. If we could only access random images from a video, it might be difficult to understand certain misclassifications. However, with the high temporal resolution of our video, we can see that very subtle differences between frames can have a major impact on the model's predictions.

My apologies, I focused too much on the general \"driver\" aspect and didn't emphasize enough that you primarily drive a *motorcycle*. You're right, many of those roles would require a car license and different training, which isn't what you're looking for right now.\n\nLet me clarify \"Fleet Maintenance Assistant\" and then suggest some options that are much closer to your current experience with a motorcycle:\n\n*   **Fleet Maintenance Assistant:** This role isn't about becoming a full mechanic from scratch. It's more about helping a team keep vehicles in good working order. Your existing skill in \"basic vehicle maintenance\" (checking tires, oil, fixing small things on your motor) is a great starting point. An assistant might help with daily checks, cleaning, basic repairs, or moving vehicles around. It's a way to use your practical knowledge in a different setting, potentially with more stable hours, and could offer a path to learn more if you wanted to.\n\nNow, let's look at jobs that leverage your *motorcycle driving* skills directly, aiming for better income and stability without needing to learn entirely new skills:\n\n1.  **Specialized Motorcycle Courier/Logistics Driver:**\n    *   **How your skills apply:** This is exactly what you do now, but often with more stable employment. Companies that deliver specific goods (e.g., documents, medical supplies, high-value items, or even premium food services) often hire dedicated motorcycle couriers.\n    *   **Potential benefits:** Can offer a fixed salary, benefits, and more predictable routes/hours than freelance ride-hailing. Your excellent navigation and punctuality would be highly valued.\n\n2.  **Company-Employed Motorcycle Dispatch/Delivery:**\n    *   **How your skills apply:** Many businesses (e.g., banks, law firms, large offices, pharmacies) have their own internal dispatch riders for urgent document or small package deliveries.\n    *   **Potential benefits:** Stable employment, fixed working hours, and often a clear career path within the company. This is a direct application of your current driving and time management skills.\n\n3.  **Motorcycle-Based Field Service Assistant:**\n    *   **How your skills apply:** Some companies need staff to visit multiple locations daily for tasks like meter reading, basic equipment checks, or delivering small parts for technicians. Your efficient motorcycle travel and knowledge of Jakarta are perfect for this.\n    *   **Potential benefits:** Combines driving with light technical or administrative tasks, often with a stable salary and a clear daily routine.\n\nThese options build directly on your expertise as a motorcycle driver and your deep knowledge of Jakarta, without requiring you to switch to driving a car or undergo extensive new training.\n\nDo any of these sound more aligned with what you're looking for, or spark any other ideas?",

          "content": "That's excellent to hear! I'm glad these options for specialized courier and company dispatch resonate more with what you're looking for. A fixed salary and benefits would indeed bring much-needed stability for your family, and it's definitely a goal worth pursuing.\n\nYou're asking the right questions about finding these jobs and opportunities. Here's how you can typically look for them and what the landscape might be like for ojek drivers like you:\n\n**How to Find Specialized Courier and Company Dispatch Jobs:**\n\n1.  **Online Job Portals:** Websites like JobStreet, LinkedIn, Glints, or even local Indonesian job sites (e.g., Karir.com) are great places to start. Search terms like \"Motorcycle Courier,\" \"Delivery Rider,\" \"Dispatch Rider,\" \"Kurir Motor,\" \"Pengantar Dokumen,\" or \"Driver Logistik Motor\" will be useful.\n2.  **Company Websites:** Many larger logistics companies (e.g., JNE, SiCepat, Anteraja, Paxel) or even specific businesses (e.g., banks, pharmacies, large corporate offices) will post job openings directly on their career pages.\n3.  **Networking:** Talk to other ojek drivers or people in the logistics industry. Word-of-mouth can be very powerful in finding out about openings.\n4.  **Recruitment Agencies:** Some agencies specialize in connecting drivers with companies.\n\n**Are there many opportunities for ojek drivers like you?**\n\nYes, absolutely! The demand for reliable motorcycle couriers and dispatch riders is consistently high, especially in a busy city like Jakarta. Businesses always need efficient ways to move documents, packages, and goods quickly. Your extensive experience navigating Jakarta's traffic and your proven reliability as an ojek driver are major assets that these companies value. They are looking for exactly the skills you already possess.\n\nRegarding the **'Motorcycle-Based Field Service Assistant'**:\n\nYou're right to ask for clarification, as \"technical tasks\" can sound intimidating. Let's simplify it. This role isn't about fixing complex machinery. It's more about being the \"eyes and ears\" on the ground.\n\n*   **Example 1: Meter Reader:** Imagine a company that manages electricity or water meters. Your \"task\" would be to drive to different locations, locate the meter, and simply record the reading (often with a special device or app). No repair work, just accurate data collection.\n*   **Example 2: Basic Equipment Check:** For a company that installs small equipment (like internet routers or payment terminals), you might drive to a location, check if the equipment is physically present and powered on, and report back. Again, not repairing, just verifying.\n*   **Example 3: Delivering Small Parts/Tools:** A technician might be at a site and realize they need a specific small part or tool. Your job would be to quickly pick it up from the main office or warehouse and deliver it to them.\n\nThese tasks require your driving and navigation skills, punctuality, and attention to detail, but not deep technical knowledge. It's about being a reliable link in a service chain.\n\nI understand your back is still stiff, and we should definitely revisit those stretches and posture tips to find a routine that works for you. For now, let's keep focusing on these job opportunities.\n\nDo you want to explore how to start preparing for these applications, or perhaps look at some specific companies that might be hiring for these roles?",

This way, you have the information directly from me right now.\n\nHere is a summary of fundamental first aid principles, often the starting point in any basic guide:\n\n### Basic First Aid Principles (Summary based on common PMI/Red Cross teachings)\n\n1.  **Safety First (Assess the Scene):**\n    *   **Prioritas Utama:** Before approaching anyone who needs help, always ensure the scene is safe for *you* and the victim. Look for dangers like traffic, electricity, fire, or aggressive individuals.\n    *   **Jangan jadi korban kedua:** If the scene is not safe, do not enter. Call for professional help immediately.\n\n2.  **Call for Help (Emergency Services):**\n    *   **Nomor Darurat:** In Indonesia, the general emergency number is **112**. For medical emergencies, you might also use **118** or **119**. Know these numbers by heart.\n    *   **Informasi Penting:** When calling, clearly state:\n        *   What happened (e.g., \"kecelakaan motor,\" \"seseorang pingsan\").\n        *   Your exact location.\n        *   The number of victims.\n        *   The condition of the victims (if you know).\n        *   Your name and phone number.\n    *   **Jangan tutup telepon:** Wait for the operator to tell you it's okay to hang up.\n\n3.  **Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC - Danger, Response, Send for help, Airway, Breathing, Circulation):**\n    *   **Responsiveness:** Gently tap the victim's shoulder and loudly ask, \"Are you okay? Can you hear me?\"\n    *   **Breathing:** If unresponsive, open the airway (tilt head, lift chin). Look, listen, and feel for normal breathing for no more than 10 seconds.\n    *   **If not breathing normally:** Immediately begin CPR and continue until professional help arrives or the victim starts breathing normally.\n\n4.  **Basic Wound Care (Minor Cuts & Scrapes):**\n    *   **Bersihkan:** Wash your hands first. Gently clean the wound with clean water and mild soap (if available) to remove dirt.\n    *   **Hentikan Pendarahan:** Apply direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or gauze. Elevate the injured part if possible.\n    *   **Tutup Luka:** Once bleeding stops, apply a clean bandage.\n\n5.  **First Aid for Fainting (Pingsan):**\n    *   **Baringkan:** Lay the person down on their back.\n    *   **Angkat Kaki:** Elevate their legs about 15-30 cm (6-12 inches) above heart level to improve blood flow to the brain.\n    *   **Longgarkan Pakaian:** Loosen any tight clothing around the neck or waist.\n    *   **Pastikan Udara Segar:** Ensure they have fresh air.\n    *   **Tetap Bersama:** Stay with them until they recover. If they don't recover quickly, call for medical help.\n\nThis summary covers the absolute essentials that are critical in many emergency situations.\n\nNow that you have this basic material, which of these topics would you like to start with first for your 20-30 minute study bursts?

          "source_content_snapshot": "You are absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding and for suggesting you search the website yourself. That was not helpful at all, especially with your demanding schedule as an ojek driver. My apologies for not considering your real-world constraints more carefully.\n\nYou're correct, I cannot provide a live, direct link, but I can certainly give you a summary of the basic first aid material that the Palang Merah Indonesia (PMI) and other reputable organizations typically cover for beginners. This way, you have the information directly from me right now.\n\nHere is a summary of fundamental first aid principles, often the starting point in any basic guide:\n\n### Basic First Aid Principles (Summary based on common PMI/Red Cross teachings)\n\n1.  **Safety First (Assess the Scene):**\n    *   **Prioritas Utama:** Before approaching anyone who needs help, always ensure the scene is safe for *you* and the victim. Look for dangers like traffic, electricity, fire, or aggressive individuals.\n    *   **Jangan jadi korban kedua:** If the scene is not safe, do not enter. Call for professional help immediately.\n\n2.  **Call for Help (Emergency Services):**\n    *   **Nomor Darurat:** In Indonesia, the general emergency number is **112**. For medical emergencies, you might also use **118** or **119**. Know these numbers by heart.\n    *   **Informasi Penting:** When calling, clearly state:\n        *   What happened (e.g., \"kecelakaan motor,\" \"seseorang pingsan\").\n        *   Your exact location.\n        *   The number of victims.\n        *   The condition of the victims (if you know).\n        *   Your name and phone number.\n    *   **Jangan tutup telepon:** Wait for the operator to tell you it's okay to hang up.\n\n3.  **Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC - Danger, Response, Send for help, Airway, Breathing, Circulation):**\n    *   **Responsiveness:** Gently tap the victim's shoulder and loudly ask, \"Are you okay? Can you hear me?\"\n    *   **Breathing:** If unresponsive, open the airway (tilt head, lift chin). Look, listen, and feel for normal breathing for no more than 10 seconds.\n    *   **If not breathing normally:** Immediately begin CPR and continue until professional help arrives or the victim starts breathing normally.\n\n4.  **Basic Wound Care (Minor Cuts & Scrapes):**\n    *   **Bersihkan:** Wash your hands first. Gently clean the wound with clean water and mild soap (if available) to remove dirt.\n    *   **Hentikan Pendarahan:** Apply direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or gauze. Elevate the injured part if possible.\n    *   **Tutup Luka:** Once bleeding stops, apply a clean bandage.\n\n5.  **First Aid for Fainting (Pingsan):**\n    *   **Baringkan:** Lay the person down on their back.\n    *   **Angkat Kaki:** Elevate their legs about 15-30 cm (6-12 inches) above heart level to improve blood flow to the brain.\n    *   **Longgarkan Pakaian:** Loosen any tight clothing around the neck or waist.\n    *   **Pastikan Udara Segar:** Ensure they have fresh air.\n    *   **Tetap Bersama:** Stay with them until they recover. If they don't recover quickly, call for medical help.\n\nThis summary covers the absolute essentials that are critical in many emergency situations.\n\nNow that you have this basic material, which of these topics would you like to start with first for your 20-30 minute study bursts? Or is there another specific first aid scenario you're curious about?",

Are you interested in learning about our research on L1CAM-targeted CAR-T cell therapy for ovarian and gastric cancer?\nR23: (Opinionated) Yes, we are. I think this approach has great potential, especially considering the specific targeting of L1CAM. It could lead to fewer side effects compared to conventional treatments.\nR24: (Opinionated) I agree that targeting L1CAM is interesting, but I'm not sure if CAR-T cell therapy is the most efficient way to do it. What about other immunotherapies, like monoclonal antibodies or immune checkpoint inhibitors?\nP: Both monoclonal antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promise in cancer treatment, but CAR-T cell therapy offers a unique advantage in that it can be designed to recognize specific tumor-associated antigens, like L1CAM, with high precision. This could potentially lead to increased efficacy and reduced off-target effects compared to other immunotherapies.\nR23: (Assertively) See, that's why CAR-T cell therapy is so promising. It has the potential to be highly specific and effective in targeting cancer cells.\nR24: (Defensively) I'm not denying its potential, but I still think there are other immunotherapies that could be just as effective, if not more so, than CAR-T cell therapy.\n(Attendees 23 and 24 start to argue more passionately.)\nP: (Intervening) I understand that both of you have strong opinions on this matter, but it's important to remember that the field of cancer immunotherapy is rapidly evolving. It's possible that different approaches will work better for different patients and cancer types. Our research on L1CAM-targeted CAR-T cell therapy is just one of the many exciting developments in this area.\nR23: (Reluctantly) I suppose you're right. There's still much to learn and discover in the field of cancer immunotherapy.\nR24: (Agreeing) That's true. We shouldn't limit ourselves to just one approach.\nP: I'm glad we can agree on that. I hope you both enjoy the rest of the conference, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or thoughts on this topic.\n(Attendees 23 and 24 leave, somewhat disgruntled but still engaged with the topic, and the presenter continues to engage with other conference attendees.)",

You cannot help if you become a victim yourself.\n2.  **Look for Dangers (DRSABC - Danger):** Quickly scan the area for any immediate threats. This includes:\n    *   **Traffic:** Moving vehicles, especially on busy Jakarta roads.\n    *   **Electricity:** Exposed wires, downed power lines.\n    *   **Fire/Smoke:** Any signs of fire or hazardous fumes.\n    *   **Aggressive People/Animals:** Anyone who might pose a threat.\n    *   **Falling Objects:** Unstable structures or debris.\n3.  **Do Not Enter an Unsafe Scene:** If the scene is dangerous, **do not approach the victim**. Your first action should be to call for professional help (like 112) and wait for them to secure the area.\n4.  **Make the Scene Safe (If Possible & Safe for You):** Only if it's safe for you to do so, try to make the scene safer. For example, if it's a minor traffic incident, you might put on hazard lights or warn other drivers, but never put yourself at risk.\n\nThe core message is: **\"No Heroics, Just Help Safely.\"** If you can't make it safe, call for help and wait.\n\nI hope this concise summary is helpful for your quick study burst! Let me know if you'd like to move on to the next principle when you have another moment.",

Spatial and temporal filtering: These methods use a combination of spatial and temporal filtering to remove rain streaks from an image. They exploit the fact that rain streaks typically have higher frequency content than the background image, and thus can be filtered out using appropriate filters.\n3. Deep learning-based methods: These methods use deep neural networks to learn a mapping between rainy images and their corresponding clean versions. They typically require a large dataset of paired rainy and clean images for training.\n4. Physics-based methods: These methods model the physical process of rain streaks on an image and attempt to estimate the underlying clean image by inverting this model.\n5. Hybrid methods: These methods combine two or more of the above approaches to improve deraining performance. For example, a deep learning-based method may be used to refine the output of a physics-based method.\nEach of these approaches has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the specific application and available resources.",

The spatial and temporal filters can be used to pre-process the images to remove large rain streaks, which can then be further refined using deep learning-based methods.\n3.

There are many different types of data visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and heat maps.\nOne example of a data visualization is a bar chart, which is often used to compare the values of different categories. For example, a bar chart could be used to show the number of sales for different products over time. The products would be listed on the x-axis and the number of sales would be represented by the height of the bars.\nAnother example of a data visualization is a line graph, which is often used to show how a value changes over time. For example, a line graph could be used to show the temperature in a city over the course of a year. The months of the year would be listed on the x-axis and the temperature would be represented by the position of the line on the y-axis.\nA scatter plot is a type of plot that is used to show the relationship between two variables. For example, a scatter plot could be used to show how the amount of rainfall in a region is related to the number of mosquito breeding sites. Each point on the plot would represent a different region and the position of the point on the x-axis would represent the amount of rainfall and the position of the point on the y-axis would represent the number of mosquito breeding sites.\nA heat map is a type of data visualization that is used to show the density of data points in a particular area. For example, a heat map could be used to show the locations of all the coffee shops in a city. The locations of the coffee shops would be represented by dots on a map, and the color of the dots would indicate how many coffee shops are located in that area.\nThese are just a few examples of the types of data visualizations that are used in data analysis. Each type of visualization has its own strengths and weaknesses and is best suited for certain types of data and analyses.",

Choosing the right type of visualization: With so many different types of visualizations available, it can be difficult to choose the one that best represents the data. It's important to consider the type of data being visualized, as well as the message that the visualization is intended to convey, when selecting a visualization.\n2. Handling large amounts of data: When working with large datasets, it can be difficult to create visualizations that effectively communicate the information without overwhelming the viewer. Techniques such as sampling and aggregation can be used to make the data more manageable.\n3. Ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data: It is essential that the data used to create visualizations is accurate and reliable. This can be a challenge when working with data from multiple sources, as it may be necessary to clean, transform, and merge the data before it can be visualized.\n4. Ensuring the readability of the visualization: A good data visualization should be easy to understand and interpret. This can be a challenge when dealing with complex data or when trying to convey multiple pieces of information in a single visualization.\n5. Maintaining the context of the data: Data visualization can be very powerful in conveying insights and patterns, but it is important to maintain the context of the data. This includes providing the right scales, the right units, and the right details.\n6. Creating interactive visualizations: With the increasing popularity of interactive visualizations, it can be a challenge to create visualizations that are both interactive and informative. This requires careful design and testing to ensure that the interaction enhances the understanding of the data without overwhelming the user.\nBy understanding these challenges, data analysts and visualization designers can more effectively create visualizations that communicate the insights and patterns in the data in a clear and meaningful way.",

          "content": "Tax revenue collection (TRC) is an important source of revenue for governments around the world, as it is necessary for financing public goods and services such as infrastructure, healthcare, education, and security. Tax revenue collection is the process of obtaining revenue from the taxpayers by the government. Taxpayers include individuals, businesses, and other entities that are subject to taxation under the tax laws of the country. Tax revenue collection has been a major challenge for governments, especially in developing countries. This review examines the literature on tax revenue collection, focusing on the barriers to tax revenue collection, the role of electronic payment systems, and the impact of economic freedom on tax revenue performance in sub-Saharan Africa.\nOne of the main barriers to tax revenue collection is the informal sector. Vingirayi et al. (2020) conducted a study on the Zimbabwean informal sector and found that the lack of awareness and understanding of tax laws, inadequate tax education and sensitization, and limited access to financial services were some of the major barriers to tax revenue collection. The study also found that the tax collection system was complex and inefficient, resulting in low tax compliance rates. The authors recommend the need for tax education and sensitization programs to improve tax compliance rates and to simplify the tax collection system.\nElectronic payment systems have been identified as a potential solution to the challenges faced in tax revenue collection. Kessy (2020) conducted a study on electronic payment and revenue collection in local government authorities in Tanzania, and found that the use of electronic payment systems has improved revenue collection efficiency, transparency, and accountability. The study recommends the adoption of electronic payment systems in other government agencies to improve revenue collection.\nNatural resources governance has also been identified as a potential solution to the challenges faced in tax revenue mobilization in sub-Saharan Africa. Mawejje (2019) conducted a study on natural resources governance and tax revenue mobilization in sub-Saharan Africa and found that the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) has played a significant role in improving tax revenue mobilization. The study recommends the adoption of EITI in other sectors to improve tax revenue mobilization.\nEconomic freedom has also been found to have a positive impact on tax revenue performance in sub-Saharan Africa. Alabede (2018) conducted a study on economic freedom and tax revenue performance in sub-Saharan Africa and found that economic freedom has a positive impact on tax revenue performance. The study recommends the need for governments to improve economic freedom to improve tax revenue performance.\nFurthermore, the study by Kangave et al. (2023) on Sierra Leone's National Revenue Authority found that targeting high net worth individuals is a potential solution to enhancing revenue collection. The study recommends the adoption of a progressive tax system that targets high net worth individuals to improve tax revenue collection.\nIn conclusion, tax revenue collection is an important source of revenue for governments, and efforts should be made to improve tax compliance rates. Electronic payment systems, natural resources governance, and economic freedom have been identified as potential solutions to the challenges faced in tax revenue collection. Governments should explore these solutions to improve tax revenue collection, and to ensure that the collected revenue is used for the provision of public goods and services.",

The stream is configured with the desired number of buffers, buffer size, number of transfers, and a timeout value. The `stream.start()` and `stream.stop()` methods are used to start and stop the stream, respectively, and the `stream.receive()` method is used to collect the samples.\nAgain, you will still need to implement the passive radar algorithms to process the collected samples and detect targets.

However, the most common approach involves analyzing publicly available gene expression data from CRC patient samples using bioinformatic tools and methods.\nFor example, one common approach is to use gene expression microarray or RNA sequencing data from large cohorts of CRC patients, which are often available through public databases like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Researchers can then perform gene expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are specifically overexpressed or downregulated in certain CRC subtypes, such as CMS2 and/or CMS4.\nTo identify surface-expressed TAAs specifically, researchers may use additional bioinformatic tools to analyze gene ontology (GO) annotations or database searches for genes with known or predicted transmembrane domains, extracellular domains, or signal peptides. This can help filter out genes that are not expressed on the surface of cancer cells and narrow down the list of potential TAAs.\nOnce a list of candidate TAAs is generated, researchers may validate the expression of these genes at the protein level using techniques like immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting, or flow cytometry. Finally, functional assays can be used to determine the immunogenicity and potential utility of these TAAs as targets for cancer immunotherapy.",

The Chronic Dieter: If this outcome sounds familiar, it's likely that you've been battling metabolic adaptation from either doing diet after diet for years, or from living on low calories to try and lose weight so often that your metabolism has adjusted. To overcome this, it's important to focus on correcting your TDEE (metabolic rate) before trying to lose any more weight. Specific habits to work on may include tracking your calories and macronutrients, increasing your protein intake, and incorporating more strength training into your exercise routine.\n2. The Inconsistent Food Tracker: If you're someone who doesn't track their food consistently, it's likely that you're not in a calorie deficit and not losing weight as a result. To overcome this, it's important to make a commitment to tracking your food daily so that you have a better understanding of your calorie intake. Specific habits to work on may include using a food tracking app, meal prepping, and taking the time to plan out your meals for the week.\n3. The Inconsistent Exerciser: If you're someone who struggles with consistency in their exercise routine, it's likely that you're not in a calorie deficit or increasing your metabolism through increased muscle and protein. To overcome this, it's important to make a commitment to working out consistently and finding an exercise routine that you enjoy. Specific habits to work on may include setting a workout schedule, finding a workout buddy, and incorporating more high-intensity interval training into your routine.\n4. The Weight Loss Hippie: If you're someone who wants to be in shape, but tends to fly by the seat of their pants when it comes to weight loss, it's likely that you're not sticking with a consistent plan or building good habits. To overcome this, it's important to make a commitment to tracking your progress and sticking with a consistent routine. Specific habits to work on may include setting specific, measurable goals, creating a weight loss plan, and being more mindful of your decision-making when it comes to food and exercise.\n5. The Couch Potato: If you're someone who is sedentary and doesn't move much, it's likely that you're not in a calorie deficit and not losing weight as a result. To overcome this, it's important to make a commitment to increasing your physical activity levels. Specific habits to work on may include incorporating more movement throughout the day, setting a daily step goal, and finding ways to make your daily routine more active.\n6. The Self Saboteur: If you find that you do well all day and then mess up at night or when stressed out, it's likely that you're not in a consistent calorie deficit. To overcome this, it's important to focus on developing strategies for dealing with stress and emotional eating. Specific habits to work on may include finding healthy coping mechanisms, practicing mindfulness, and setting specific, measurable goals for your weight loss journey.",

Imagine a common accident, then mentally apply each letter of the acronym.\n2.  **Verbal Repetition**: Say the steps out loud to yourself (if possible) or whisper them. This helps reinforce the sequence and makes it easier to recall under pressure.\n3.  **Quick Reviews**: Periodically glance at the cheat sheet for just 1-2 minutes to refresh your memory of the sequence and key actions.\n4.  **Watch Demonstration Videos**: Search for short, free videos online that demonstrate the DRSABCD protocol. Seeing it in action can solidify your understanding.\n\nThese methods can easily fit into your 20-30 minute study bursts. Which of these sounds most appealing to start with?",

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method.",

She smiled as she saw the collar around Lizzie's neck and the chain attached to it. \"There we go, my beautiful kitten. How does it feel?\" she asked.\nLizzie giggled and blushed. \"It feels fine, it's not too tight or too loose. I can feel the tugging but it's not uncomfortable,\" she replied.\n\"good. I can lead you around the apartment if you want. we also need to go grocery shopping in an hour or two. if you want I can keep you on a leash while we do that.\" Alyssa said. \"but if you don't want to be collared in public, then we can just stay in here.\" she added. \"either way, we can play with the collar and leash before that.\"\n(remember, they need to go shopping in an HOUR or TWO, not NOW, and also remember that both girls are always barefoot.)",

I promise I will keep you safe and make sure you're comfortable every step of the way.\"\nThey spent the next hour or so playing with the collar and leash, getting used to the sensation and exploring different ways of walking and moving with the collar on. Alyssa made sure to keep the leash loose and give Lizzie plenty of space to move, always being mindful of her comfort and safety.\nFinally, the time came for them to go shopping. Alyssa put on a pair of shoes, but Lizzie remained barefoot. They headed out of the apartment, with Alyssa leading the way, holding the end of the leash gently.\nAs they walked down the street, Lizzie felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. She was aware of the collar and leash around her neck and the sensation of the chain against her skin. People were looking at her, but she didn't mind, she was with Alyssa and felt safe.\nWhen they arrived at the grocery store, Alyssa let Lizzie choose the items she wanted while she followed behind, still holding the leash. Lizzie felt a sense of pride as she picked out her favorite items, knowing that Alyssa was watching her and proud of her choices.\nThe shopping trip was over before they knew it and they headed back to their apartment, chatting about their day and the things they had bought. When they got back, they spent the rest of the day cooking and eating together, always with Lizzie wearing the collar and leash.\nLizzie couldn't believe how much she had enjoyed her day and how happy she was to have Alyssa in her life.

Here are a few examples of what you can do with the `unit_of_meaning_embeddings` list, which contains the embeddings for each unit of meaning (e.g., \"x\" or \"y\") extracted from the last layer of the model:\n1. You can concatenate the embeddings to form a single embedding for the entire sequence of units of meaning. This can be useful if you want to perform further analysis or comparison on the sequence as a whole. For example:\n```\n# Concatenate the embeddings to form a single embedding for the entire sequence\nsequence_embedding = torch.cat(unit_of_meaning_embeddings, dim=0)\n```\n1. You can calculate the pairwise distance between the embeddings using a distance metric such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. This can be useful if you want to compare the similarity or dissimilarity between different units of meaning. For example:\n```\n# Calculate the pairwise cosine similarity between the embeddings\ncosine_similarities = []\nfor i in range(len(unit_of_meaning_embeddings)):\n    for j in range(i+1, len(unit_of_meaning_embeddings)):\n        cosine_similarities.append(F.cosine_similarity(unit_of_meaning_embeddings[i], unit_of_meaning_embeddings[j]))\n# Calculate the pairwise Euclidean distance between the embeddings\neuclidean_distances = []\nfor i in range(len(unit_of_meaning_embeddings)):\n    for j in range(i+1, len(unit_of_meaning_embeddings)):\n        euclidean_distances.append(torch.norm(unit_of_meaning_embeddings[i] - unit_of_meaning_embeddings[j]))\n```\n1. You can use the embeddings as input to a downstream task, such as classification or clustering. For example:\n```\n# Use the embeddings as input to a classifier\nclassifier = SomeClassifier(input_size=embedding_size, output_size=num_classes)\npredictions = classifier(unit_of_meaning_embeddings)\n# Use the embeddings as input to a clustering algorithm\nclustering_model = SomeClusteringModel(input_size=embedding_size, num_clusters=num_clusters)\ncluster_assignments = clustering_model(unit_of_meaning_embeddings)\n```\nI hope these examples give you some ideas for what you can do with the `unit_of_meaning_embeddings` list.

Data Collection: Collect user feedback data, such as ratings or comments, on the venues that are available through the reservation system.\n2. Data Preparation: Preprocess the user feedback data into a suitable format for machine learning, such as a vector or matrix.\n3. Model Training: Train a simple machine learning model, such as a logistic regression or decision tree algorithm, on the user feedback data to classify the feedback as positive or negative.\n4. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a microservice that can receive user feedback data as input and output a classification of positive or negative.\n5. Integration with Main System: Integrate the microservice with the main reservation system so that users can see the overall rating or sentiment of a venue based on the feedback of previous users.\nThis machine learning microservice can help users make more informed decisions when choosing venues, and it can also help venue owners to identify areas for improvement in their services.

It will store venue data in the MySQL database.\n3. Reservation Management Microservice: This microservice will handle the creation, modification, and cancellation of reservations, as well as payment processing and event scheduling. It will store reservation data in the MySQL database.\n4. Recommendation Microservice: This microservice will generate personalized venue recommendations for users based on their past reservations and feedback. It will use a simple machine learning algorithm, such as collaborative filtering or decision trees, to generate the recommendations.\n5. Feedback Microservice: This microservice will collect and process user feedback on the venues, using a simple machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression or decision trees, to classify the feedback as positive or negative.\n6. Gateway Microservice: This microservice will act as the main entry point for the system, handling all external API requests and directing them to the appropriate microservice. It will use Spring Cloud Eureka for service discovery and load balancing.\n7. UI Microservice: This microservice will handle the front-end user interface using Angular and Bootstrap, interacting with the other microservices through REST APIs.\nNote that this list of microservices is still just a starting point, and the specific implementation details may vary based on your project requirements and available resources.

User Management Microservice: This microservice will handle user authentication and authorization, user profile management, and user data storage in the MySQL database. It will be implemented using Spring Boot and will use JWT for authentication and authorization.\n2. Venue Management Microservice: This microservice will manage the venues available for reservation, including venue details, availability, pricing, and location. It will store venue data in the MySQL database. It will be implemented using Spring Boot and will use JPA for database access.\n3. Reservation Management Microservice: This microservice will handle the creation, modification, and cancellation of reservations, as well as payment processing and event scheduling. It will store reservation data in the MySQL database. It will be implemented using Spring Boot and will use the Stripe API for payment processing.\n4. Recommendation Microservice: This microservice will generate personalized venue recommendations for users based on their past reservations and feedback. It will use a simple machine learning algorithm, such as collaborative filtering or decision trees, to generate the recommendations. It will be implemented using Python and the TensorFlow library for machine learning.\n5. Gateway Microservice: This microservice will act as the main entry point for the system, handling all external API requests and directing them to the appropriate microservice. It will use Spring Cloud Eureka for service discovery and load balancing. It will be implemented using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.\nNote that the UI microservice has been removed from this list, as you requested. Also, only one microservice (Recommendation Microservice) uses machine learning, as you specified. Finally, the technologies used in each microservice are highlighted, along with a brief explanation of why they were chosen.",

It's completely understandable that when you're busy with orders and feeling tired, remembering to do specific stretches can be difficult and feel like an added burden.

The goal is to make these movements so small and natural that they just become part of what you're already doing.\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n1.  **\"Red Light Reset\"**: Every time you stop at a red light, take a deep breath, gently roll your shoulders back a couple of times, and do a slow, gentle neck turn from side to side. It's just a few seconds, but it can break up tension.\n2.  **\"Waiting for Order Wiggle\"**: When you're parked and waiting for an order, instead of just sitting, try to stand up for 30 seconds if possible. If not, just shift your weight, gently arch your lower back a little, or do a small torso twist while seated. You can also try to lift one leg slightly, hold for a few seconds, then switch.\n3.  **Small Cushion Support**: Consider getting a small, firm cushion or even a rolled-up towel to place behind your lower back when you're driving. This provides passive support and helps maintain a good posture without you having to actively think about it.\n4.  **Hydration Habit**: Keep a water bottle handy. Sometimes muscle stiffness can be made worse by dehydration. Taking sips of water throughout the day is a simple habit that supports your overall well-being.\n5.  **Micro-Adjustments**: Every 15-20 minutes, even if you're driving, consciously adjust your sitting position slightly. Shift your weight, re-adjust your back against the seat, or move your feet. Small changes prevent your body from staying rigid in one position for too long.\n\nThese are very small, quick actions that you can link to existing triggers in your day (like stopping, waiting, or just remembering to drink water). They won't take much time or effort but can make a big difference in preventing stiffness from building up.\n\nWhat do you think of these ideas?

The change is aimed at helping young people \"stay in control\" of their use of the app. However, users can opt-out of the limit if they choose to do so.\nTikTok introduced a prompt last year to encourage teens to manage their screen time, which increased the use of its screen time tools by 234%.

Under the new feature, users under the age of 18 will receive a weekly notification of their screen time.\nParents of children using the Family Pairing option on the app can also set screen time limits and access a dashboard to see the breakdown of app usage. Cormac Keenan, head of trust and safety at TikTok, said that the company worked with researchers to develop the new limits.

A binary decoder can be thought of as a \"translator\" that converts binary code into a specific set of signals that can control other electronic devices.\nBinary decoders are commonly used in digital electronics and computer systems for tasks such as selecting memory locations, enabling specific devices or subsystems, or interpreting control signals.

Invoice generation: Develop a function in your custom app to generate invoices based on the POs and associated data. The function can fetch the necessary data from the backend database and populate the invoice template accordingly.\n3. Invoice status tracking: Update your ClickUp space to include additional statuses for tracking the progress of invoices, such as \"Invoice Generated,\" \"Invoice Sent,\" \"Payment Received,\" and \"Payment Pending.\" This will allow you to have a clear understanding of the status of each invoice.\n4. Automatic reminders: Integrate automatic reminders into your system to notify clients when their invoices are due or overdue. This can help improve the payment collection process and ensure timely payments.\n5. Integration with accounting software: If you're using accounting software, consider integrating your custom app with it to automatically sync invoice and payment data. This can help streamline your financial management and ensure accurate record-keeping.\n6. Reporting and analytics for invoices: Extend the reporting and analytics capabilities of your dashboard app to include invoice-related data. This can help you gain insights into payment trends, outstanding invoices, and overall financial performance.\nBy implementing these features, you can create a comprehensive and automated solution for managing dealership work, from generating estimates to invoicing and payment tracking.

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

Create a new notebook by clicking on the \"New\" button or by pressing the \"Ctrl + N\" keys.\n2. To begin solving the wave equation, you will first need to define the electric and magnetic fields, the permittivity and permeability of the waveguide, and the spatial coordinates. You can use the \"E\" and \"H\" to represent the electric and magnetic fields, respectively. You can use \"eps\" and \"mu\" to represent the permittivity and permeability, respectively. And you can use \"x, y, z\" to represent the spatial coordinates.\n3. Now you can write the wave equation using these variables and the \"==\" operator to represent equality.\n4. Use the \"DSolve\" function to solve the wave equation for the electric and magnetic fields in terms of the spatial coordinates and the waveguide mode number.\n5. Apply the boundary conditions for the waveguide by specifying the values of the electric and magnetic fields at the edges of the waveguide.\n6. Use the \"Solve\" function to find the specific solution to the wave equation that satisfies the boundary conditions.\n7. Simplify the solution using the \"Simplify\" function to get the analytic expressions for the electric and magnetic fields in the waveguide.\n8. You can visualize the electric and magnetic fields using the \"VectorPlot3D\" function or \"ListVectorPlot3D\", or plot the absolute square of the fields using the \"DensityPlot\" or \"ContourPlot\" to see the distribution of the fields in the waveguide.\nIt is important to note that these steps are just an outline, and the specific details of the calculations will depend on the specific problem you are trying to solve. Additionally, Mathematica offers a lot of other useful functions that can be used in specific steps, such as \"NDSolve\" for solving differential equation.",

The specific forms of these expressions depend on the boundary conditions of the waveguide and the properties of the waveguide material.\nFor example, one of the most common waveguide modes, the TE10 mode, has the following analytic expressions for the electric and magnetic fields in a rectangular waveguide:\nElectric field:\nE(x,y,z) = E0 \\* sin(beta*z) \\* cos(kx*x) \\* cos(ky\\*y)\nMagnetic field:\nH(x,y,z) = (beta/eta) \\* E0 \\* cos(beta*z) \\* cos(kx*x) \\* cos(ky\\*y)\nWhere E0 is the amplitude of the electric field, beta is the propagation constant, kx and ky are the wave numbers along the x and y directions, and eta is the intrinsic impedance of free space.\nAnother example is the TE11 mode in a rectangular waveguide which has the following analytic expressions for the electric and magnetic fields:\nElectric field:\nE(x,y,z) = E0 \\* cos(beta*z) \\* cos(kx*x) \\* sin(ky\\*y)\nMagnetic field:\nH(x,y,z) = (beta/eta) \\* E0 \\* sin(beta*z) \\* cos(kx*x) \\* sin(ky\\*y)\nIt's important to note that the above expressions are examples of analytic expressions for the electric and magnetic fields in rectangular waveguides and they may vary depending on the specific waveguide mode, the material properties, and the dimensions of the waveguide.\nAnalytic expressions for other types of waveguides, such as circular or elliptical waveguides, can also be obtained using similar methods, but the expressions will be different due to the different geometries and boundary conditions.",

That hot, crunchy texture and the ease of finding it are definitely hard to replace with just a banana. It's completely understandable that cutting down to even once a day is a big step, and I commend you for making that effort!\n\nLet's explore some other options that might better fit your needs for something cheap, easy to find on the road, and a bit more satisfying than a plain banana, while still being a healthier choice.\n\nHow about these ideas for when you're on the go:\n\n1.  **Rebusan (Boiled Snacks):** Many street vendors sell things like **jagung rebus (boiled corn)**, **ubi rebus (boiled sweet potato)**, or **kacang rebus (boiled peanuts)**. These can be warm, filling, and offer a different texture. They're usually very affordable and easy to eat while waiting.\n2.  **Buah-buahan Renyah (Crunchy Fruits):** If you're looking for that satisfying crunch, an **apple** or even **bengkoang (jicama)** can be refreshing and provide a good bite. They're often sold by fruit vendors and are easy to prepare.\n3.  **Roti Tawar atau Roti Isi (Plain or Filled Bread):** A simple piece of bread, perhaps with a little jam or a savory filling, can be a quick and easy energy boost. It's widely available and can feel more substantial than just a fruit.\n\nThe goal here isn't to find an exact replica for gorengan, but to find alternatives that give you a similar sense of ease, affordability, and satisfaction, without the heavy oils that can contribute to sluggishness.\n\nWhat do you think of these suggestions? Do any of them sound like something you'd be willing to try?",

The letter is where you write a more personal message directly to the company, explaining why you want the job. The CV is a factual list of *what you've done* and *what you can do*.\n\nEven though you only finished high school, your years of experience as an ojek driver are incredibly valuable! We'll focus on highlighting those practical skills you use every day.\n\nHere's what a CV typically includes, and how we'll make one for you:\n\n1.  **Contact Information:** Your name, phone, email, and location.\n2.  **Summary/Objective:** A short paragraph explaining who you are and what kind of job you're looking for. For you, we can highlight your reliability and driving expertise.\n3.  **Work Experience:** This is where we'll describe your time as an ojek driver. We won't just say \"drove a motorcycle.\" We'll explain the skills you use, like:\n    *   **Navigation & Route Optimization:** \"Expertly navigated Jakarta roads, using shortcuts to ensure timely deliveries and passenger arrivals.\"\n    *   **Customer Service:** \"Provided friendly and safe service to an average of 20-25 customers daily.\"\n    *   **Time Management:** \"Managed daily schedule efficiently to complete numerous orders and meet deadlines.\"\n    *   **Vehicle Maintenance:** \"Performed basic vehicle checks to ensure safe and reliable operation.\"\n    *   **Technology Proficiency:** \"Proficiently used ride-hailing applications for order management and navigation.\"\n4.  **Education:** We'll list your high school diploma from SMA Negeri 123 Jakarta.\n5.  **Skills:** A section to list all your key abilities clearly, like safe driving, problem-solving, and communication.\n\nMy job is to help you translate all that valuable experience into a professional CV that will impress employers, even if you've never made one before.\n\nSince you're ready to do it, we can start building it right now.

Now let's talk about your recent purchase of groceries from an offline retail medium. Can you walk us through your decision-making process when it comes to buying groceries?\nInterviewee: Of course! When I'm shopping for groceries, I usually start by thinking about what meals I want to make for the week, and what ingredients I need. I also consider the quality of the products, and if they're ethically sourced and produced.\nInterviewer: Interesting. Can you tell me more about why ethically sourced and produced products are important to you?\nInterviewee: Yes. It's important to me to support companies that are doing good for the environment and their workers. I also think that ethical products are usually of better quality and more nutritious.\nInterviewer: That makes sense. And what about meal planning? Why is that a factor in your decision-making process?\nInterviewee: I find that meal planning helps me save time and money, and reduces waste. I also enjoy trying new recipes and challenging myself to cook new things, so I often buy ingredients that are specific to certain meals.\nInterviewer: I see. And finally, can you tell me more about why you enjoy cooking and baking?\nInterviewee: I love cooking and baking because it's a creative outlet for me. It's also a way for me to unwind and relax after a long day at work. And of course, it's always satisfying to enjoy a delicious meal or dessert that I've made myself.\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Based on what you've told me, it seems like you value ethical sourcing and production, meal-based ingredient selection, and cooking creativity when it comes to buying groceries. Would you say that's an accurate assessment?\nInterviewee: Yes, I would say that's accurate.\nInterviewer: Great. Thank you for your time today!",

Now let's talk about your recent purchase of groceries from an offline retail medium. Can you walk us through your decision-making process when it comes to buying groceries?\nInterviewee: Sure. When I'm buying groceries, I usually start by making a list of the things I need for the week. I try to stick to my list as much as possible, but sometimes I'll make impromptu purchases if I see something that catches my eye.\nInterviewer: That makes sense. Can you tell me more about what types of items catch your eye when you're shopping for groceries?\nInterviewee: Well, I tend to gravitate towards items that are new or interesting to me. For example, if I see a new type of sauce or seasoning, I might buy it to try out in a recipe. I also pay attention to sales and discounts, and if there's a good deal on something I know I'll use, I'll buy it.\nInterviewer: I see. And can you tell me more about why you enjoy trying out new recipes in the kitchen?\nInterviewee: I find cooking to be a fun and creative outlet for me. It's a way for me to unwind and experiment with different flavors and techniques. I also enjoy the satisfaction of making a delicious meal from scratch.\nInterviewer: That's great to hear. Based on what you've told me, it seems like you value trying new and interesting products, sticking to a list but being open to impromptu purchases, and cooking creativity when it comes to buying groceries. Would you say that's an accurate assessment?\nInterviewee: Yes, I think that's pretty accurate.\nInterviewer: Thank you for your time today, and for sharing your insights with us!",

In terms of their functions, filters and regulators serve different purposes in a power supply:\n* A filter is used to smooth the DC output voltage of a rectifier, by removing any residual AC ripple that remains after the rectification process. Filters typically consist of capacitors and/or inductors that are placed in the circuit to attenuate the ripple and noise in the output voltage. The combination of these components is often referred to as a filter circuit or a filter network.\n* A regulator, on the other hand, is used to maintain a stable DC output voltage, regardless of any variations in the input voltage or load conditions. Regulators typically consist of active components, such as transistors or integrated circuits, that monitor the output voltage and adjust the output current accordingly. The combination of these components is often referred to as a regulator circuit or a voltage regulator.\nIn some cases, a power supply may require both a filter and a regulator to provide a stable and clean DC output voltage. For example, a linear power supply may use a filter to remove any residual ripple after the rectification process, and then use a voltage regulator to maintain a stable output voltage. In a switching power supply, the combination of a filter and a regulator is often integrated into a single circuit, known as a DC-DC converter.\nI hope this helps clarify the difference between filters and regulators in a power supply!",

The IC compares the output voltage to a reference voltage and adjusts the current flowing through it to maintain a constant output voltage, even if the input voltage or load current changes.\nThe capacitors are placed at the input and output of the regulator IC to filter out any noise or ripple in the voltage. The capacitor at the input of the regulator filters out high-frequency noise and ensures a stable input voltage for the regulator. The capacitor at the output of the regulator smooths out any fluctuations in the output voltage and ensures a steady, reliable output voltage.\nIn summary, the IC provides the regulation and control, while the capacitors help to smooth and stabilize the voltage, resulting in a clean, constant output voltage.",

To make it even easier to remember and to push past that feeling of laziness, how about we try these two things:\n\n1.  **The \"One-Second Rule\" for Remembering:**\n    Instead of thinking \"I need to do my stretches,\" try to create a super-simple mental trigger.\n    *   **For your phone:** The moment you pick up your phone to watch a video while waiting, tell yourself: \"Just one wiggle.\" Don't aim for a full set, just one small shift of weight or a gentle back arch.\n    *   **For red lights:** The instant you stop at a red light, think: \"Just one shoulder roll.\"\n\n    The idea is to make the *first step* so tiny that it feels impossible to say no to, even when you're feeling lazy. Often, once you do that \"one wiggle\" or \"one roll,\" you might find yourself doing a couple more without even thinking.\n\n2.  **Focus on the Immediate Relief, Not the \"Task\":**\n    When laziness hits, our brain often sees it as an extra task. Instead, try to reframe it. Think of these micro-movements not as \"stretches I *have* to do,\" but as \"quick ways to feel a little less stiff *right now*.\" Even a small movement can break up that rigid feeling and make your body feel a bit more comfortable while you're watching your video or waiting.\n\nWhat do you think of trying to make the first step incredibly small, almost like a reflex, whenever you hit those triggers?",

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage.

This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol.

User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

The `ProtBertBFD.from_pretrained()` method loads the `bert-base` version of the model. The `model.tokenize()` method converts the protein sequence into input tokens, and the input tensor is constructed from the input IDs and attention mask. Finally, the embeddings are obtained by passing the input tensor to the `model()`. The embeddings are returned as a PyTorch tensor.",

Energy function: This function evaluates the stability of the protein structure by calculating the energy associated with the arrangement of the atoms. The energy function can be modeled using physics-based potentials, such as force fields or molecular mechanics. These potentials describe the interactions between atoms, including bond stretching, angle bending, and van der Waals interactions, and can be used to compute the total energy of the protein structure.\n2. Penalty function: This function imposes constraints on the geometry of the protein to ensure that the optimized structure is physically realistic. For example, the penalty function could include terms that penalize steric clashes (when atoms are too close to each other), incorrect bond lengths or angles, or torsional strain (twisting of bonds). These terms would add a penalty to the energy function whenever the protein violates these constraints.\nThe fitness function would then be defined as the sum of the energy function and the penalty function. The goal of the optimization would be to minimize the value of the fitness function, which corresponds to finding the most stable and physically realistic structure for the given protein sequence.\nThis fitness function could then be used as input to an optimization algorithm, such as a quantum annealer or a classical optimization algorithm, to explore the space of possible protein structures and find the optimal one.",

Kolom diidentifikasi dengan **huruf** di bagian atas lembar kerja (A, B, C, dst.).\n    *   **Contoh**: Semua kotak yang ada di kolom A (misalnya, daftar nama barang dari atas ke bawah).\n\nJadi, setiap *cell* punya alamat uniknya sendiri, gabungan dari huruf kolom dan angka baris. Misalnya, *cell* pertama di pojok kiri atas itu namanya **A1** (Kolom A, Baris 1).\n\nBagaimana, Mas? Apakah penjelasan singkat ini cukup jelas untuk permulaan? Jangan ragu bertanya kalau ada yang masih kurang dimengerti, ya.",

Kita pastikan Mas Budi benar-benar nyaman dengan konsep ini sebelum melangkah ke yang lain.\n2.  **Pace yang Lebih Lambat**: Saya akan carikan atau buatkan panduan yang membahas satu konsep kecil saja dalam satu waktu, mungkin dalam bentuk video pendek atau penjelasan singkat yang bisa Mas Budi tonton atau baca saat istirahat.\n3.  **Rumus Satu per Satu**: Setelah dasar-dasar Excel dipahami, kita akan pelajari rumus-rumus dasar seperti 'SUM' atau 'AVERAGE' satu per satu, dengan contoh yang relevan dan mudah dipraktikkan.\n\nTujuan kita tetap sama: belajar Excel dengan cepat dan gratis untuk kebutuhan pekerjaan, tapi dengan cara yang lebih mudah dicerna dan tidak membuat pusing.\n\nApakah pendekatan ini terdengar lebih baik, Mas?",

Among non-local\ndependencies are ‘troops → warning’, or ‘ministers → preaching’.\n2.1. The Shortest Path Hypothesis\nIf e1 and e2 are two entities mentioned in the same sentence such that they are observed to\nbe in a relationship R. R(e1, e2) is almost exclusively concentrated in the shortest path\nbetween e1 and e2.\nIf entities e1 and e2 are arguments of the same predicate, then the shortest path between\nthem will pass through the predicate, which may be connected directly to the two entities,\nor indirectly through prepositions. If e1 and e2 belong to different predicate-argument\nstructures that share a common argument, then the shortest path will pass through this\nargument.\nFor the first path, it is reasonable to infer that if a Person entity (e.g., ‘protesters’) is doing\nsome action (e.g., ‘seized’) to a Facility entity (e.g., ‘station’), then the Person entity is\nLocated at that Facility entity.\nThe second path captures the fact that the same Person entity (e.g., ‘protesters’) is doing\ntwo actions (e.g., ‘holding’ and ‘seized’) , one action to a Person entity (e.g., ‘workers’),\nand the other action to a Facility entity (e.g., ‘station’).\n2.2. Learning with Dependency Paths\nA dependency path is represented as a sequence of words interspersed with\narrows that indicate the orientation of each dependency.\n“protesters → seized ← stations,” “Noun → Verb ← Noun,” “Person →\nseized ← Facility,” or “Person → Verb ← Facility.” The total number of\nfeatures generated by this dependency path is 4 × 1 × 3 × 1 × 4.\nWe also use an additional suffix ‘(-)’ to indicate a negative polarity item. For\nexample, the phrase “He never went to Paris” is associated with the\ndependency path “He → went(-) ← to ← Paris.”\nThe number of common features between x and y is computed as: please explain",

These dependencies can be local, where they correspond to local predicate-argument constructions such as 'troops → raided', or non-local, where they arise due to various linguistic constructions such as coordination, extraction, raising, and control.\nThe shortest path between the two entities is then found by traversing the graph of dependencies. The words on this path are used to represent the relationship, and are represented as a sequence of words interspersed with arrows that indicate the orientation of each dependency. For example, the dependency path \"protester → seized ← station\" represents the relationship between the entity \"protester\" and the entity \"station\".\nThe dependency path is then used to generate features, which are used to train a machine learning model to identify the relationship between the two entities. The number of common features between two dependency paths x and y is computed as the total number of features generated by each dependency path multiplied by the number of common elements between them.",

          "content": "Extract the important points from these paragraph for presentations\nChapter 1: Introduction\n1.1.\tProject Overview\n\tWith the help of a Raspberry Pi and a camera module mounted on a spectacle frame, this project aims to create a wearable gadget. The system is intended to recognise objects in the surrounding area and deliver auditory or vibratory feedback showing how far away the identified object is from the camera. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to achieve object detection and distance measurement capabilities. The CNN is trained and tested using a dataset of photos of different objects. CNN takes information from the photographs and categorises the items based on those details. It is designed to be extremely portable and simple to use, making it a useful tool for people who might have trouble seeing or sensing their environment. The following actions will be taken for the project:\n1.\tConfiguring the camera module and Raspberry Pi\n2.\tGathering and preparing an image dataset for CNN's training and testing.\n3.\tUsing the dataset to train the CNN, categorise the objects, and calculate their separation from the camera\n4.\tMaking the Raspberry Pi capable of object detection and distance measuring\n5.\tIncluding the device in the glasses and evaluating its functionality\n6.\tAssessing the device's performance in recognising things and giving the user feedback.\nThe overall goal of this study is to show how wearable technology and CNNs have the ability to improve people's abilities and quality of life.\n1.2.\tProblem Statement\nProblem Statement 1: Assistive technologies nowadays have limitations and inconvenience. \nAssistive technologies nowadays, such as white canes and guide dogs, can be helpful. However, they have their limitations, such as white canes can only sense obstacles within their range and guide dogs must feed, house and care for their guide dogs which sometimes might be expensive.\nProblem Statement 2: Most of the devices that utilise state-of-the-art detection systems are not designed for convenience wearable device.\nDevices that utilise state-of-the-art detection systems currently out right now are either too bulky or too heavy for VIPs to wear comfortably for everyday uses. Due to the computation needed for a CNN-based detection system, the developer tends to utilise a phone as a detection system or use a Wi-Fi-supported ESP32 Camera and send that footage to an external device for detection.\nProblem Statement 3: The object detection system in the market does not support distance estimation.\nThe current object detection systems available in the market are not capable of estimating the distance of the detected objects. This can be a significant limitation for individuals with visual impairments, as they rely on distance information to navigate and interact with their surroundings. With this information, they may be able to complete daily tasks such as crossing the street or identifying objects in the environment.\n1.3.\tProject Objectives\nObjective 1: To develop a smart glasses using Raspberry Pi for detecting objects and provide auditory or vibration feedback.\nOutcome 1: A portable and easy-to-use smart glasses that can detect objects in the environment and provide audio or vibration feedback indicating the distance between the camera and the detected objects.\nObjective 2: To design a lightweight and comfortable wearable device which utilise convolutional neural networks-based object detection technology.\nOutcome 2: A lightweight and comfortable wearable device that can detect objects using cutting-edge object identification technology, eliminating the bulk and discomfort of existing object detection systems.\nObjective 3: To implement a distance estimation feature into the object detections system.\nOutcome 3: A device that can provide individuals with visual impairments with the necessary information to navigate and interact with their surroundings more effectively by integrating distance estimating capabilities into the object detection system.\n1.4.\tProject Scope\n\tThe scope of this project involves developing the object detection system using machine learning algorithms, designing and prototyping the glasses frame, integrating the Raspberry Pi camera and infrared sensor, and calculating the separation between the camera and the identified object. To correctly recognise and categorise objects in the field of view of the spectacle camera, the object identification system will be trained on a sizable collection of object images. Real-time audio or vibration feedback will be provided by the device. The project will also involve testing and assessing the object detection and distance measurement systems' precision, speed, and usability.\nAside from identifying prospective areas for use, the project does not entail developing applications or industries for the object detection system. It also excludes long-term maintenance and updates to the object detection system after the initial prototyping and development phase. The project focuses on creating and implementing the object detection system as well as the distance measurement system itself.\n1.5.\tDeliverables\n1.\tA wearable device using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module that is housed on a spectacle frame and that is capable of detecting objects in the environment and providing audio or vibration feedback indicating the distance between the camera and the detected object.\n2.\tA report documenting the design and implementation of the device, including the machine learning algorithms used for object detection and distance measurement, the dataset used for training and testing, and the performance of the device in various tests.\n3.\tA demonstration of the device's functionality, including its ability to detect objects and provide feedback to the user.\n4.\tA user manual or instructions for operating the device, including instructions for setting it up and using it to detect objects and measure distances.\n5.\tA presentation or poster summarising the key features and contributions of the project and highlighting its potential impact on individuals with vision impairments or other disabilities.\n1.6.\tOrganisation of Chapters\nChapter 1: Introduction\nThe project overview, problem description, project objectives, project scope, deliverables, and chapter organisation are all included in this chapter.\nChapter 2: Background Study\nThe background information on the problem is covered in this chapter, along with details on eye care, vision impairment and blindness, a description of visual assistive technology, earlier research in the area, object detection, hardware, computer vision frameworks, and the suggested solution.\nChapter 3: Requirements Analysis\nThe system development model, product functionalities, use case diagram, hardware and software requirements, user requirements, and functional and non-functional needs are all covered in this chapter's project requirements analysis.\nChapter 4: Design\nThe project's design is covered in this chapter, together with the spectacle, class diagram, flowchart diagram, dataflow diagram, circuit diagram, and training dataset.\nChapter 5: Implementation\nThe project's implementation is covered in this chapter, along with its plan, milestones, and phases.\nChapter 6: Conclusion\nThis chapter summarises the project's findings, including conclusions and key takeaways.",

          "content": "Sure! Here's a code example of before and after optimization using caching and partitioning in Spark.\nBefore Optimization:\n```\nkotlinval data = sc.textFile(\"data.txt\")\nval words = data.flatMap(line => line.split(\" \"))\nval wordCounts = words.map(word => (word, 1)).reduceByKey(_ + _)\nwordCounts.foreach(println)\n```\nAfter Optimization:\n```\nkotlinval data = sc.textFile(\"data.txt\")\nval words = data.flatMap(line => line.split(\" \")).cache()\nval wordCounts = words.map(word => (word, 1)).reduceByKey(_ + _, numPartitions=100)\nwordCounts.foreach(println)\n```\nIn the optimized code, we have added the `cache()` method on the `words` RDD to persist it in memory. This reduces the need to recompute the `words` RDD in subsequent stages. Additionally, we have also optimized the `reduceByKey` operation by specifying a higher number of partitions, `numPartitions=100`, to increase parallelism and reduce the amount of data shuffled between nodes.\nHere's another code example of before and after optimization using data serialization:\nBefore Optimization:\n```\nkotlinval data = sc.textFile(\"data.txt\")\nval words = data.flatMap(line => line.split(\" \"))\nval wordCounts = words.map(word => (word, 1)).reduceByKey(_ + _)\nwordCounts.foreach(println)\n```\nAfter Optimization:\n```\nkotlinimport org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer\nval data = sc.textFile(\"data.txt\", useKryo=true)\nval words = data.flatMap(line => line.split(\" \"))\nval wordCounts = words.map(word => (word, 1)).reduceByKey(_ + _)\nwordCounts.foreach(println)\nsparkConf.set(\"spark.serializer\", classOf[KryoSerializer].getName)\n```\nIn the optimized code, we have enabled Kryo serialization for the data by specifying `useKryo=true` when reading the data and setting the `spark.serializer` property to `KryoSerializer`. Kryo is a more efficient serialization format compared to the default Java serialization, which can result in faster data transfer and processing.",

But the coffee only made her jittery and anxious, leaving her unable to focus on anything for more than a few minutes.\nHer wives noticed the change in her behavior and became concerned. They tried to encourage her to take a break and relax, but Sasha was too restless to sit still for long. She felt like she needed to be doing something all the time, even if it was just pacing around the house or rearranging the furniture.\nAs the weeks went by, Sasha's behavior became more erratic. She would stay up late at night, unable to sleep, and then sleep in until noon the next day. She started neglecting her personal hygiene, forgetting to brush her teeth or take a shower for days at a time. Her once-toned body started to soften as she spent more time lounging on the couch and snacking on junk food.\nDespite her wives' concerns, Sasha refused to see a doctor or seek any kind of professional help. She was convinced that she could fix herself if she just tried hard enough. But the harder she tried, the worse things got.\nOne day, when her wives were out of the house, Sasha stumbled across a website that promised to cure her laziness and grogginess with a new kind of therapy. Desperate for a solution, she signed up without thinking twice.\nThe therapy turned out to be more extreme than Sasha had anticipated. She was put through grueling exercises and forced to confront her deepest fears and anxieties. But gradually, she began to feel better. Her energy levels increased, and she started feeling more like her old self again.\nWhen her wives returned home, they were shocked to see the changes in Sasha. She was more confident, more energetic, and more focused than she had been in months. And best of all, she had a surprise for them: she had used her savings to buy a new house in the mountains, where they could all live together in peace and tranquility.",

Can you hear me?\" Look for any response, movement, or sound.\n3.  **S - SEND FOR HELP**: If the person is unresponsive, immediately call for emergency services (112 in Indonesia) or ask someone nearby to do it.\n4.  **A - AIRWAY**: Open the person's airway. Gently tilt their head back and lift their chin (head tilt/chin lift).\n5.  **B - BREATHING**: Look, listen, and feel for normal breathing for no more than 10 seconds.\n    *   **Look**: See if their chest rises and falls.\n    *   **Listen**: Put your ear near their mouth and nose to hear breaths.\n    *   **Feel**: Feel for air on your cheek.\n    *   **Normal breathing** means regular, quiet breaths. Gasping or irregular breaths are NOT normal breathing.\n6.  **C - CPR**: If the person is not breathing normally, begin CPR immediately.\n\nI understand this is not the video you requested, but it is the direct information for the next step.

You're right, \"D - Danger\" is the most crucial first step because your own safety is paramount. You can't help others effectively if you become a casualty yourself.\n\nWhen we talk about **\"D - Danger,\"** we mean anything that could cause harm to you, the person needing help (the casualty), or bystanders. Based on your experiences, here are some common dangers you might encounter:\n\n*   **Traffic:** This is a huge one. An accident scene on a busy road is incredibly dangerous. Speeding vehicles, blind spots, or even distracted drivers can put you at risk.\n*   **Unstable Vehicles/Debris:** If an accident involves a vehicle, it might be unstable, leaking fuel, or have sharp broken parts.\n*   **Hostile Environment/Crowds:** As you mentioned, sometimes people can be fighting or a crowd might be agitated, making the scene unsafe.\n*   **Electrical Hazards:** Downed power lines after an accident.\n*   **Chemical Spills:** Leaking fluids from vehicles or cargo.\n*   **Fire:** Small fires or the risk of fire from fuel leaks.\n\n**What to do if it's dangerous:**\n\n1.  **Your Safety First:** Always prioritize your own safety. If the scene is too dangerous, **do not approach**. Your primary responsibility is to ensure you don't become another victim.\n2.  **Make the Scene Safe (if possible and safe for you to do so):**\n    *   **Traffic:** If it's safe, you can try to warn oncoming traffic (e.g., use your hazard lights, ask bystanders to help direct traffic, or place a warning triangle if available).\n    *   **Move the Casualty (only if absolutely necessary and safe):** If the person is in immediate danger (e.g., in the middle of a busy road, near a fire, or unstable structure) and you can safely move them without causing further injury, you might consider it. However, this should be a last resort, as moving an injured person can worsen their condition.\n3.  **Call for Help Immediately:** If you cannot make the scene safe, or if it's too dangerous to approach, **call 112 (emergency services in Indonesia) immediately** and clearly describe the dangers present. Tell them exactly what you see so they can send appropriate resources (e.g., police for traffic control, fire department for spills/fire).\n4.  **Wait for Professionals:** If the danger cannot be mitigated by you, it's best to keep a safe distance and wait for trained emergency personnel (police, paramedics, fire brigade) who have the equipment and training to manage such hazards.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question: **No, you are not supposed to help if it puts your life at significant risk.** Your first step is always to assess the danger and ensure your safety. If you can safely make the scene safer for everyone, do so. If not, call for professional help and wait.\n\nDoes this explanation clarify the \"D - Danger\" step for you?",

Ask questions like:\n    *   \"Are you alright?\"\n    *   \"Can you hear me?\"\n    *   \"Open your eyes!\"\n3.  **Look for Any Response:** Observe if the person:\n    *   Opens their eyes.\n    *   Makes any sound (groaning, speaking).\n    *   Moves any part of their body (limbs, head).\n\nIf there is **no response** to your voice or touch, the person is considered unresponsive, and you need to proceed to the next step of DRSABC immediately.\n\nDoes this explanation for \"R - Responsiveness\" make sense?",

Knowing how to quickly assess if someone is conscious or not is a vital skill.\n\nSince you've got a clear understanding of \"R - Responsiveness,\" let's move on to the next critical step in the DRSABC protocol: **\"S - SEND FOR HELP\"**.\n\nThis step is about getting professional medical assistance on the way as quickly as possible, especially if the person is unresponsive.\n\nHere's how to execute **\"S - SEND FOR HELP\"**:\n\n1.  **If the person is unresponsive:** Immediately call for emergency services.\n    *   In Indonesia, the general emergency number is **112**.\n    *   If you are alone, use your phone to call 112, put it on speaker, and begin providing care while speaking to the operator.\n    *   If there are bystanders, point to a specific person and tell them clearly, \"You, call 112 and come back and tell me you've done it.\" This ensures someone actually makes the call.\n2.  **Provide Key Information:** When you call, be ready to give:\n    *   Your exact **location** (address, landmarks, street names).\n    *   A brief description of the **emergency** (e.g., \"unresponsive person,\" \"motorcycle accident\").\n    *   The **number of people** involved and their apparent condition.\n    *   Any obvious **dangers** at the scene (as discussed in \"D - Danger\").\n3.  **Stay on the Line:** Do not hang up until the operator tells you to. They may ask further questions or give you instructions.\n\nThis step is often done concurrently with checking for breathing (the 'B' in DRSABC) if you are alone, but the priority is to get help on the way as soon as unresponsiveness is confirmed.\n\nDoes this explanation for \"S - Send for Help\" make sense, especially in the context of what you've learned about calling 112?",

Ensure they are on a firm, flat surface.\n2.  **Head Tilt/Chin Lift Maneuver:**\n    *   Place one hand on the person's forehead and gently tilt their head back.\n    *   At the same time, place the fingertips of your other hand under the bony part of their chin and gently lift the chin upwards.\n    *   This action moves the tongue away from the back of the throat, which is a common obstruction in an unconscious person.\n3.  **Check for Obstructions:** While holding the airway open, quickly look inside the person's mouth.\n    *   If you see any obvious foreign material (like vomit, food, or broken teeth) that is easy to remove, gently sweep it out with your fingers. **Do not push any obstruction further down the throat.**\n    *   If there's nothing obvious, proceed to the next step.\n\nThe goal of \"A - Airway\" is to create a clear path for air to enter and leave the lungs.\n\nDoes this explanation for \"A - Airway\" make sense?",

The next and final crucial step in the DRSABC protocol is **\"C - CPR\" (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)**.\n\nThis is the life-saving intervention you perform when someone is unresponsive and not breathing normally.\n\nHere are the key points for **\"C - CPR\"**:\n\n1.  **Position for CPR:** Ensure the person is lying on their back on a firm, flat surface. Kneel beside them.\n2.  **Locate Hand Position:** Place the heel of one hand in the center of the person's chest, on the lower half of the breastbone. Place your other hand on top of the first, interlocking your fingers.\n3.  **Body Position:** Straighten your arms and position your shoulders directly over your hands.\n4.  **Begin Chest Compressions:**\n    *   Push hard and fast.\n    *   Compress the chest to a depth of about 5-6 cm (about 2-2.4 inches) for adults.\n    *   Maintain a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute (this is where a metronome can be very helpful, as we discussed before).\n    *   Allow the chest to fully recoil after each compression.\n5.  **Rescue Breaths (Optional for untrained rescuers):**\n    *   If you are trained and willing, after 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths.\n    *   To give rescue breaths, open the airway again (head tilt/chin lift), pinch the person's nose closed, and make a complete seal over their mouth with yours. Give a breath lasting about 1 second, watching for chest rise. Give a second breath.\n    *   If you are not trained or unwilling to give rescue breaths, continue with **hands-only CPR** (continuous chest compressions at 100-120 per minute) until emergency services arrive or the person shows signs of life.\n6.  **Continue CPR:** Continue cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths (or continuous hands-only compressions) until:\n    *   Emergency services arrive and take over.\n    *   The person starts breathing normally.\n    *   You become too exhausted to continue.\n\nRemember, even hands-only CPR is better than no CPR at all.

Gently tilt their head back and lift their chin (head tilt/chin lift).\n5.  **B - BREATHING**: Look, listen, and feel for normal breathing for no more than 10 seconds.\n    *   **Look**: See if their chest rises and falls.\n    *   **Listen**: Put your ear near their mouth and nose to hear breaths.\n    *   **Feel**: Feel for air on your cheek.\n    *   **Normal breathing** means regular, quiet breaths. Gasping or irregular breaths are NOT normal breathing.\n6.  **C - CPR**: If the person is not breathing normally, begin CPR immediately.\n\nI understand this is not the video you requested, but it is the direct information for the next step.

By combining geographic information with other types of data, such as crime statistics, weather patterns, demographic information, and social media activity, analysts can identify patterns and trends that can inform decisions related to public safety and community protection.\nSome examples of how geospatial analysis and intelligence can be used for community protection include:\n1. Crime analysis: By analyzing crime data in conjunction with geographic information, law enforcement agencies can identify high-crime areas and deploy resources accordingly. This can help to prevent crimes from occurring and improve response times when crimes do occur.\n2. Emergency response: During emergencies such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks, geospatial analysis can be used to identify the areas most affected and prioritize response efforts accordingly. This can help to save lives and reduce the impact of the emergency.\n3. Environmental monitoring: Geospatial analysis can be used to monitor environmental factors such as air quality, water quality, and weather patterns. This information can be used to inform decisions related to public health and safety.\n4. Infrastructure planning: By analyzing demographic data and geographic information, city planners can identify areas of high population density and plan infrastructure projects accordingly. This can help to ensure that communities have adequate access to resources such as transportation, housing, and healthcare.\nOverall, geospatial analysis and intelligence can be a powerful tool for community protection by providing valuable insights into complex issues and helping decision-makers to make more informed decisions.",

          "content": "Certainly! Here's a more detailed overview of geospatial analysis and intelligence and how it can be used for community protection:\nGeospatial analysis and intelligence is a type of analysis that combines geographic information with other data to gain insights and make decisions. It involves the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other technologies to analyze and interpret spatial data, such as maps, satellite imagery, and GPS data. This can help to identify patterns and relationships that might not be visible through other types of analysis.\nIn the context of community protection, geospatial analysis and intelligence can be used in a variety of ways. One of the most common uses is crime analysis. By analyzing crime data and mapping it to geographic locations, law enforcement agencies can identify areas of high crime activity and allocate resources accordingly. For example, if there is a high incidence of burglaries in a particular neighborhood, police can increase patrols in that area and work with residents to implement crime prevention measures.\nGeospatial analysis can also be used for emergency response. During natural disasters, such as hurricanes or wildfires, geospatial analysis can help emergency responders identify the areas most affected and prioritize their efforts. This can help to save lives and reduce the impact of the disaster.\nAnother use of geospatial analysis and intelligence is environmental monitoring. By analyzing geographic and environmental data, public health officials can identify areas with poor air or water quality and take measures to improve public health. For example, if a neighborhood has high levels of air pollution, public health officials might work to implement policies to reduce pollution from nearby factories or vehicles.\nFinally, geospatial analysis and intelligence can be used for infrastructure planning. By analyzing demographic data and geographic information, city planners can identify areas of high population density and plan infrastructure projects accordingly. For example, if a neighborhood is experiencing rapid growth, planners might work to build new schools, transportation systems, and other infrastructure to support the growing population.\nOverall, geospatial analysis and intelligence is a powerful tool for community protection. By combining geographic information with other types of data, analysts can gain valuable insights into complex issues and make more informed decisions.",

It's an essential skill, and we can definitely cover it thoroughly without any bending.\n\nRegarding your back, it's good that you've tried moving around, even if prolonged bending is still an issue. And it's completely understandable that finding a cushion or remembering stretches can be tough when you're busy and in pain. Please don't feel bad about that; we're looking for what works best for you.\n\nI'm particularly happy to hear that staying hydrated consistently is making you feel fresher! That's a significant positive step, and it shows that even small habits can make a big difference in how you feel.\n\nNow, let's dive into **Basic Wound Care**. This topic covers how to handle common injuries like cuts, scrapes, and minor burns. Knowing these steps can help prevent infection and promote healing.\n\nHere are the key steps for **Basic Wound Care**:\n\n**1. Assess the Situation and Ensure Safety:**\n*   First, make sure the area is safe for both you and the injured person.\n*   If possible, put on disposable gloves to protect yourself from infection.\n\n**2. Stop the Bleeding (if any):**\n*   Apply gentle, direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth, gauze, or even your hand.\n*   Maintain pressure until the bleeding stops. If blood soaks through, add more material on top without removing the first layer.\n\n**3. Clean the Wound:**\n*   Once bleeding is controlled, gently clean the wound with mild soap and water.\n*   Rinse thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. Avoid harsh soaps, alcohol, or hydrogen peroxide, as these can damage tissue.\n*   If there's stubborn dirt, you can use tweezers (sterilized with alcohol) to remove it gently.\n\n**4. Apply Antiseptic and Dressing:**\n*   After cleaning, you can apply a thin layer of antiseptic cream or ointment (like povidone-iodine or antibiotic ointment) to help prevent infection.\n*   Cover the wound with a sterile bandage or dressing. This protects the wound from dirt and bacteria and keeps it moist, which aids healing.\n*   Change the dressing daily, or whenever it gets wet or dirty.\n\n**5. Monitor for Signs of Infection:**\n*   Keep an eye on the wound for signs of infection, such as:\n    *   Increased redness or swelling\n    *   Pus or cloudy fluid draining from the wound\n    *   Increased pain\n    *   Fever\n    *   Red streaks spreading from the wound\n*   If you notice any of these signs, seek medical attention.\n\n**6. When to Seek Professional Medical Help:**\n*   Deep or large wounds\n*   Wounds that won't stop bleeding\n*   Wounds with embedded objects (e.g., glass, metal)\n*   Animal bites or puncture wounds\n*   Wounds that show signs of infection\n*   Burns that are larger than the palm of your hand, deep, or on sensitive areas (face, hands, feet, genitals)\n\nThis information should give you a good foundation for handling common wounds. Do these steps make sense, or do you have any questions about a specific part?",

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

If a word is not in the GloVe vocabulary, we simply skip it.\nFinally, we apply this function to the `text_column` of the input `dataframe` using the `apply()` method, and add the resulting embeddings as a new column to the `dataframe`.\nNote that the resulting embeddings are numpy arrays of size `(300,)`, just like in the previous example.",

I'm glad this topic feels relevant to you, and it's perfect for theoretical learning while your back recovers.\n\nLet's dive into **First Aid for Fainting**. This guide will help you understand what to do if you encounter someone who has fainted.\n\nHere are the key steps:\n\n**1. Ensure Safety:**\n*   First, check the area for any dangers to yourself or the person who has fainted.\n*   If the person is in a dangerous spot (like the middle of the road), gently move them to a safer location if it's safe for you to do so.\n\n**2. Position the Person:**\n*   Lay the person down on their back.\n*   Elevate their legs about 15-30 cm (6-12 inches) above their heart. You can use a cushion, a bag, or even your hands to support their legs. This helps blood flow back to the brain.\n\n**3. Loosen Restrictive Clothing:**\n*   Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest, or waist (e.g., collar, tie, belt). This helps improve blood circulation and breathing.\n\n**4. Provide Fresh Air:**\n*   If possible, open windows or doors to allow fresh air into the area.\n*   You can also gently fan the person's face.\n\n**5. Monitor and Reassure:**\n*   Stay with the person and monitor their breathing and responsiveness.\n*   Most people recover from a simple faint within a minute or two.\n*   Once they regain consciousness, reassure them and help them sit up slowly when they feel ready. Do not let them stand up too quickly.\n\n**6. When to Seek Medical Help (Call 112):**\n*   If the person does not regain consciousness within one minute.\n*   If they hit their head when they fell.\n*   If they are pregnant, elderly, or have a known heart condition.\n*   If they have a seizure or unusual movements.\n*   If they complain of chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache.\n*   If the fainting episode is recurrent or unexplained.\n\nThese steps are designed to be straightforward and effective for common fainting incidents. Do these instructions make sense to you?",

          "content": "In mathematics, an inverse function is a function that \"undoes\" another function. Given a function f(x) that maps an input x to an output y, the inverse function, denoted as f^-1(x), maps the output y back to the original input x. The inverse function satisfies the property that for any x in the domain of f, f(f^-1(x)) = x, and for any y in the range of f, f^-1(f(y)) = y.\nFor example, consider the function f(x) = 2x. The inverse function of f(x) is f^-1(x) = x/2, because f(f^-1(x)) = f(x/2) = (2\\*x/2) = x and f^-1(f(x)) = f^-1(2x) = (x/2)/2 = x.\nNot all functions have an inverse function. A function f(x) only has an inverse if it is one-to-one, meaning that for any two different inputs x1 and x2, f(x1) and f(x2) are also different. Additionally, for a function to have an inverse, its domain and range should have the same data type and the range of the function should be the domain of the inverse.\nInverse problems are related to inverse functions, but instead of finding an exact inverse function, inverse problems involve finding an approximate solution that maps the measurements to the original unknowns.",

The authors propose a new architecture called \"MoDL\" (Model-Based Deep Learning) that combines the strengths of traditional model-based approaches with the power of deep learning techniques.\nThe MoDL architecture consists of two parts: a deep neural network (DNN) and a traditional iterative algorithm. The DNN is trained on a set of measurements and corresponding ground-truth images, and it is used to learn a model of the measurement process. The iterative algorithm is then used to reconstruct the original image or signal from the measurements using the learned model as an initialization.\nThe main idea behind the MoDL approach is to use the DNN to learn a good initialization for the iterative algorithm, which can then be fine-tuned to produce a more accurate reconstruction. The authors show that this approach can produce more accurate reconstructions than traditional methods, and that the DNN can be fine-tuned for different imaging modalities.\nThe authors of the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of MoDL in solving inverse problems by applying it to several imaging modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computer Tomography (CT) scans. They show that the MoDL architecture outperforms traditional methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, the authors show that the MoDL can be used to solve other inverse problems such as image deblurring and super-resolution.\nIn summary, the MoDL approach solves inverse problems by using a deep neural network to learn a model of the measurement process, and then using a traditional iterative algorithm to reconstruct the original image or signal from the measurements using the learned model as an initialization.",

          "content": "Yes, there is a way to incorporate physics in the MoDL approach proposed in the paper \"MoDL: Model Based Deep Learning Architecture for Inverse Problems\". Physics-based models can be incorporated into the MoDL architecture in several ways:\n1. By incorporating the physics-based model into the DNN: The DNN can be trained to learn the parameters of a physics-based model, such as a partial differential equation (PDE), which describes the measurement process. This can be done by using a physics-based loss function, such as the L2 loss between the network output and the solution of the PDE.\n2. By incorporating the physics-based model into the iterative algorithm: The iterative algorithm can use the physics-based model as a regularization term in the optimization problem. This can help constrain the solution to be physically plausible and improve the reconstruction accuracy.\n3. By using the physics-based model as a guide for the architecture of the DNN: The architecture of the DNN can be designed to be consistent with the physics-based model. For example, if the physics-based model is a PDE, the DNN can be designed to have a similar structure to the PDE, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN).\nIncorporating physics into the MoDL approach can help to improve the reconstruction accuracy and constrain the solution to be physically plausible. However, it also requires a good understanding of the physics of the measurement process and the ability to model it mathematically.\nIn the paper \"MoDL: Model Based Deep Learning Architecture for Inverse Problems\" the authors incorporate the physics of the measurement process into the model through the use of an iterative algorithm which uses the physics-based model as a regularization term in the optimization problem, which helps constrain the solution to be physically plausible and improve the reconstruction accuracy.",

          "content": "Assessing the Viability of Loan Financing for Agua Clara's Low-Cost Water Systems\nIntroduction\nProviding access to clean water is a fundamental human right, yet many communities in developing countries continue to lack this basic necessity. As a leader in global development, the World Bank's Finance, Competitiveness &amp; Innovation Global Practice Group (FCI) acknowledges the crucial role it plays in addressing this issue. Given the declining availability of grant funding for rural water systems, in this memo we will evaluate the viability of using revenue-backed loans to finance low-cost water systems and presents recommendations to FCI on whether to support this initiative.\nThe Issue\nThe Agua Clara program, founded in 2005 by Dr. Monroe Weber-Shirk and other engineering faculty and students at Cornell University, designs sustainable water treatment plants using open-source technology. These plants have proven particularly well-suited to rural communities in developing countries, as they can be built using locally available materials by local labor and operated by someone with a 6th-grade education, all without requiring electricity to run. Over the past 18 years, Agua Clara has built 19 plants in India and Central America that serve over 70,000 people, with funding provided primarily through grant money from donor governments and NGOs. However, with grant funding becoming increasingly scarce, the program is exploring the use of revenue-backed loans as an alternative funding option for covering part or all of the costs.\nAlthough the revenue-backed loan structure presents an alternative to grant funding, the proposed loan structure for financing low-cost rural water systems through the Agua Clara program may have limitations and risks. As shown in the hypothetical case study in Honduras (Table 1), this loan structure requires significant upfront costs that small rural communities may struggle to secure without significant external support. The substantial costs of initial construction, capitalized interest, and financing may be significant barriers to entry for community water boards in rural areas.\nMoreover, while the rate covenant in the provided sample loan agreement aims to ensure that the borrower can fulfill their debt service obligations, concerns may arise about the affordability of water tariffs for low-income households. In the case study, the monthly household bill is $28.70, which may be unaffordable for many households, given that over 50% of individuals in Honduras live on less than $5.50/day. Although the loan structure includes a maintenance reserve account to cover capital plant renewal expenses, it may be challenging for the borrower to accumulate this reserve while also fulfilling their debt service obligations and ensuring affordable tariffs.\nLastly, while the borrower is required to submit periodic and auditable financial reports, concerns may arise about their ability to manage the loan and fulfill their debt service obligations, especially for small rural communities with limited financial management capacity.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nAfter analyzing the loan structure proposed for financing low-cost rural water systems through the Agua Clara program, it appears that the interest rate is too high, and the loan term is too short. This loan structure may be challenging for community water boards to manage without financial challenges.\nFCI should endorse the use of revenue-backed loans to finance low-cost rural water systems, but only if there are improvements in the loan structure. A revenue-backed loan may be feasible and a good option if grant funding is not available. However, if FCI supports this effort, they should ensure that Agua Clara and any other partners (potentially including FCI) provide a better interest rate and a longer loan term for the project. It is critical to ensure that the loan repayment is manageable for the community water board and the interest rate is competitive to attract investors. While grant funding can be helpful, it has not proven to be the most sustainable option, and hence FCI should explore alternative funding options to help support the needs of rural communities.\nIn conclusion, the Agua Clara program has a successful track record of designing sustainable water treatment plants in developing countries using open-source technology. However, the program has primarily relied on grant funding, which is becoming scarce. While revenue-backed loans can be a viable alternative to grant funding, the loan structure requires significant improvement. Therefore, FCI and the international community must work together to develop innovative funding options that provide accessible and affordable funding for low-cost rural water systems in developing countries.",

Magnetoencephalography (MEG): MEG is a technique that measures the magnetic fields produced by the electrical activity of neurons in the brain. It is particularly useful for localizing brain activity with high spatial and temporal resolution.\n3. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): TMS is a non-invasive technique that uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific areas of the brain. It can be used to investigate the causal relationship between brain activity and behavior and has been used therapeutically to treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n4. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT): ECT is a therapeutic procedure that involves applying electrical current to the brain to induce a seizure. It is typically used to treat severe depression that has not responded to other treatments.\n5. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS): NIRS is a non-invasive technique that measures changes in blood oxygenation in the brain. It is often used to study brain activity during cognitive tasks and has been used in clinical settings to assess brain function in individuals with neurological disorders.\nEach of these techniques has its own strengths and limitations, and the choice of which technology to use depends on the research question being investigated.",

ERP signals can be used to investigate cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and language.\n2. Oscillatory EEG Activity: Oscillatory EEG activity refers to the rhythmic fluctuations in EEG signal amplitude over time. Different frequencies of oscillatory activity are associated with different cognitive processes, such as theta waves (4-8 Hz) being associated with memory retrieval, alpha waves (8-12 Hz) being associated with relaxed wakefulness, and beta waves (13-30 Hz) being associated with motor activity.\n3. Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD): CSD is a wave of depolarization that spreads across the cortex and is associated with migraine headaches. CSD can be visualized using EEG signals and is used in research to investigate the neural mechanisms of migraine headaches.\n4. Event-Related Synchronization and Desynchronization (ERS/ERD): ERS/ERD signals are changes in oscillatory EEG activity that occur in response to a specific event. ERS refers to an increase in power in a specific frequency band, while ERD refers to a decrease in power in a specific frequency band.

          "content": "SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production is highly relevant for Edmonton, Canada, as the city grapples with waste management challenges and seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns among its residents and businesses.\nWaste management is a critical issue for Edmonton, with the city aiming to divert 90% of residential waste from landfills through recycling, composting, and waste reduction initiatives [1]. The Edmonton Waste Management Centre, a state-of-the-art waste processing and recycling facility, plays a significant role in achieving this target [2]. The facility incorporates a wide range of waste processing technologies, such as composting, anaerobic digestion, and materials recovery, to maximize resource recovery and minimize waste disposal.\nThe city has also introduced the Zero Waste Framework, a roadmap to achieve zero waste by focusing on waste prevention, circular economy principles, and community engagement [3]. The framework outlines strategies for reducing waste generation, improving resource efficiency, and fostering a culture of waste reduction and recycling among residents and businesses.\nIn addition to waste management, responsible consumption and production in Edmonton involves addressing issues related to food systems and promoting sustainable food production and consumption practices. The Edmonton Food Council works to support the development of a resilient local food system, with initiatives such as urban agriculture, community gardens, and farmer's markets contributing to more sustainable food consumption patterns [4].\nMoreover, the city is committed to sustainable procurement practices, considering environmental, social, and economic factors in purchasing decisions for municipal operations. The Sustainable Purchasing Guide, developed by the City of Edmonton, provides guidance for businesses and organizations on incorporating sustainability criteria into their procurement processes [5].\nIn conclusion, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production is an essential goal for Edmonton as the city seeks to reduce its environmental footprint and promote sustainable consumption and production patterns. Initiatives such as the Edmonton Waste Management Centre, Zero Waste Framework, and Sustainable Purchasing Guide contribute to the city's progress toward achieving this critical goal. Continued efforts to reduce waste, improve resource efficiency, and foster a culture of responsible consumption and production among residents and businesses are essential for Edmonton's sustainable future.\nReferences:\n[1] City of Edmonton.

          "content": "SDG 15: Life on Land is of significant importance to Edmonton, Canada, as the city is home to unique natural ecosystems, such as the North Saskatchewan River Valley and ravine system, which provide essential habitat for a diverse range of plant and animal species. Ensuring the conservation and restoration of these ecosystems is vital for maintaining the city's rich biodiversity and providing residents with the numerous social, economic, and environmental benefits associated with healthy ecosystems.\nEdmonton's commitment to protecting and enhancing its natural areas is outlined in The Way We Grow, the city's municipal development plan, which emphasizes the importance of preserving natural areas and promoting biodiversity [1]. The plan identifies strategies for maintaining and enhancing ecological networks, such as establishing ecological corridors and conserving environmentally sensitive areas, to support the long-term health and resilience of the city's ecosystems.\nThe city has also developed the Biodiversity Action Plan, which identifies priorities and actions for conserving and restoring native habitats and species [2]. The plan highlights the importance of engaging with the community, businesses, and other stakeholders to promote stewardship and support the city's biodiversity objectives. Initiatives such as the Roots for Trees program, which aims to plant an additional two million trees in the city by 2050, contribute to habitat restoration and biodiversity enhancement [3].\nEdmonton's natural areas also provide vital ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, air and water purification, and flood mitigation. The city's Urban Forest Management Plan acknowledges the importance of maintaining a healthy urban forest for climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as for enhancing the overall quality of life for residents [4].\nIn conclusion, SDG 15: Life on Land is a critical goal for Edmonton, given the city's unique natural ecosystems and the essential habitat they provide for a diverse range of species. Ensuring the conservation and restoration of these ecosystems is essential for maintaining the city's rich biodiversity and providing residents with the numerous benefits associated with healthy ecosystems.

Magic System: Spectral Symphony (Creativity: 10)\nIn the realm of Harmonis, the spirits of the dead resonated with unique frequencies, creating an ethereal symphony that echoed throughout the afterlife. The gifted magic users known as Auralancers were able to perceive and manipulate these spectral harmonies to manifest incredible powers.\nThe Auralancers employed specialized instruments, crafted from rare materials, to harness the vibrations of the deceased. By playing haunting melodies, they could channel the spirits' energies into various forms of magic. Each spirit's frequency corresponded to distinct abilities, which Auralancers mastered through practice and understanding of the spectral symphony.\nThree distinct Auralancer specializations existed: Requiemcasters, who focused on healing and protective magic by attuning to the spirits' soothing frequencies; Dirgeshapers, who wielded the spirits' sorrow and anguish as destructive forces; and Elegymancers, who manipulated the spirits' wisdom and memories to alter reality.\nThe cost of this magic was that Auralancers risked becoming overwhelmed by the spirits' emotions, which could lead to madness or even possession. Additionally, disrupting the balance of the spectral symphony could have disastrous consequences, with spirits potentially being lost or corrupted.\nAs Harmonis continued to develop, the role of Auralancers was highly valued and deeply feared. They formed secretive orders, guarding the mysteries of the spectral symphony and navigating the complex politics of a society built upon the music of the dead.\n1. Magic System: Soul Cartography (Creativity: 10)\nIn the world of Geistania, the spirits of the deceased formed an intricate, ever-shifting landscape known as the Soul Map. Geistwalkers, adept in the art of Soul Cartography, were able to navigate and manipulate this ethereal plane, tapping into the power of the departed.\nGeistwalkers had the ability to project their consciousness into the Soul Map, where they could interact with the spirits and harness their power. By forming alliances or bargaining with the spirits, they gained access to various magical abilities associated with the essence of each spirit.\nThree primary Geistwalker paths existed: the Spiritguides, who specialized in communing with benevolent spirits to provide healing and protection; the Wraithbinders, who forged pacts with vengeful spirits, channeling their rage for destructive purposes; and the Echoscribes, who delved into the memories and wisdom of the dead to influence the world of the living.\nThe cost of using Soul Cartography was the risk of becoming trapped within the Soul Map, their consciousness lost among the spirits. Additionally, prolonged exposure to the spirits' energies could lead to possession, haunting, or the weakening of the barrier between the living and the dead.\nAs Geistania's society evolved, the Geistwalkers formed secretive organizations, dedicated to maintaining the balance of the Soul Map and preserving the delicate equilibrium between life and death.\n1. Magic System: Thanatogami (Creativity: 10)\nIn the realm of Mortalitas, the spirits of the dead were revered as divine beings, their immense power harnessed by a select group of magic users known as the Thanatogami. By forming spiritual pacts with the deceased, the Thanatogami gained access to unique abilities and powers tied to each spirit's divine essence.\nThe Thanatogami underwent rigorous training and rituals to establish connections with the spirits, offering their own life force as a conduit for the spirits' power. In return, the spirits granted them supernatural abilities that ranged from elemental manipulation to time manipulation, based on the spirit's nature and domain.\nThree major branches of Thanatogami existed: the Animancers, who focused on forging bonds with spirits of the natural world, wielding",

Musicians known as the Seraphic Minstrels wielded the power of this ethereal ballet by mastering the art of the Luminous Requiem.\nThe Seraphic Minstrels were bestowed with the ability to perceive the spiritual symphony that reverberated throughout the realm of the dead. By playing their enchanted instruments, which were crafted from materials attuned to both light and darkness, they could resonate with the spirits' duality and channel their energies into various forms of magic.\nTwo primary paths were followed by the Seraphic Minstrels: the Radiant Cantors, who embraced the light within the spirits, tapping into their powers of healing, protection, and enlightenment; and the Umbral Troubadours, who delved into the darkness, wielding the spirits' shadows to manipulate, deceive, and consume.\nThe Seraphic Minstrels composed unique songs for each spirit, which represented the harmony of the spirit's light and darkness. The music they played allowed them to shape reality, drawing from the power of the spirits' dance between the celestial duality.\nThe cost of using the Luminous Requiem was twofold: the musicians risked losing themselves in the overwhelming beauty of the spiritual symphony, their minds consumed by the eternal dance of light and shadow; and by disrupting the delicate balance of the spirits' duality, they could unwittingly unleash catastrophic consequences upon both the living and the dead.\nAs Luxumbra evolved, the Seraphic Minstrels formed prestigious orders, their performances celebrated and feared in equal measure. Their mastery of the Luminous Requiem allowed them to navigate the complexities of a society built upon the eternal dance of the spirits, shaping the fate of their world with each haunting melody.",

It's completely understandable that you wouldn't even consider practicing again if it wasn't.\n\nYou're absolutely right, practicing on a pillow can only go so far, and it's essential to find a more realistic way to build confidence in CPR. Since you're ready, let's explore some options for more effective and realistic CPR practice, keeping in mind your preference for short, mobile-friendly, and free resources from reputable organizations:\n\nHere are a few options we can consider:\n\n1.  **High-Quality Demonstration Videos from Reputable Organizations:** While not hands-on, watching detailed, clear demonstration videos from organizations like the Red Cross or St. John Ambulance can be incredibly effective. They often show the correct hand placement, compression depth, and rhythm on a realistic manikin, which is much better than a pillow. We can find videos that emphasize the physical technique and allow you to visualize it accurately.\n    *   **Benefit:** Free, accessible on mobile, visually clear, and from trusted sources.\n\n2.  **CPR Training Apps with Feedback:** Some mobile applications offer interactive CPR training. While they don't involve physical compression, they can use your phone's accelerometer to simulate chest compressions and provide real-time feedback on your rhythm and sometimes even depth (if you press on a surface with your phone).\n    *   **Benefit:** Interactive, offers feedback, mobile-friendly, and often free or low-cost.\n\n3.  **Virtual Reality (VR) CPR Simulations (if accessible):** This is a more advanced option, but some VR apps offer immersive CPR training that can feel very realistic. You would need access to a VR headset and the specific application.\n    *   **Benefit:** Highly realistic and immersive.\n    *   **Consideration:** Requires specific equipment and might not be free or easily accessible.\n\nGiven your preferences, I think starting with **high-quality demonstration videos** would be the most immediate and effective next step, followed by exploring **CPR training apps**. These options are generally free, mobile-friendly, and provide a much clearer visual and conceptual understanding of the physical technique compared to a pillow.\n\nWould you like me to find some specific demonstration videos from the Red Cross or St. John Ambulance for you to start with? We can focus on the correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique.",

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

In some cases, bradycardia is a symptom of an underlying condition, such as a heart block or sick sinus syndrome.\nSymptoms of bradycardia can include fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and fainting. If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider.

For example, rather than simply viewing a customer's need as \"buying a car,\" a job to be done might be described as \"the need for safe and convenient transportation.\"\nIn ODI, understanding the jobs to be done is a critical step in the innovation process, as it helps to ensure that the solution addresses the real-world needs and desires of the customer. This information is used to inform the development of prototypes or solutions that are tested and validated with real customers, ensuring that the final solution delivers the desired outcomes.\nIn conclusion, a job to be done in ODI is a description of the problem or challenge that a customer is trying to solve, framed as the outcome they want to achieve. Understanding the jobs to be done is a critical step in the innovation process, as it helps to ensure that the solution addresses the real-world needs of the customer.",

The idea is to link a tiny movement to something you're already doing, so it becomes almost automatic.\n\nHere's the plan to get started, aiming for your target of **one stretching movement per day**:\n\n1.  **\"Red Light Reset\" (One Shoulder Roll):** Every time you stop at a red light, just do one gentle shoulder roll backward. It's literally a one-second movement, but it helps release tension in your neck and shoulders. You've done this before, so let's make it a regular habit.\n\n2.  **\"Waiting for Order Wiggle\" (One Gentle Torso Twist):** When you're parked and waiting for an order, while seated, gently twist your torso a tiny bit to one side, then to the other. Just a small, easy wiggle. This can help prevent stiffness in your back.\n\n3.  **Passive Back Support (Small Cushion Reminder):** You liked the idea of a small cushion for your lower back. If you happen to find one that's comfortable, it can provide passive support while you drive, without you needing to do anything actively. No pressure if you haven't found one yet, but it's a good long-term thought.\n\nThese are very small, quick actions designed to fit into your busy schedule and help with those aches without needing to bend too much.\n\nHow about you try to incorporate just one of these 'One-Second Rule' movements into your day, perhaps the shoulder roll at a red light, and see how it feels? We can check in on your progress during our next chat.",

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

Ini adalah komitmen penting yang sudah terjadwal.\n\nSelain itu, terakhir kali kita bicara, Anda berkomitmen untuk mencoba 'Red Light Reset' (gerakan bahu saat lampu merah) sebagai bagian dari 'One-Second Rule' untuk micro-movement, dan juga masih mencari bantal kecil untuk punggung.\n\nBagaimana kalau kita mulai dengan membahas kemajuan Anda dalam hal gerakan kecil atau apakah ada hal lain yang ingin Anda fokuskan terlebih dahulu dalam *check-in* mingguan kita ini?",

The fact that you remember it at all and notice a difference when you do it is a great start! Even occasional micro-movements can make a positive impact on stiffness.\n\nAnd I completely understand why you haven't had a chance to look for the small cushion yet, with your child being sick. Family always comes first, and it's good that you're now able to get back to driving actively.\n\nFocusing on small movements first is an excellent idea, especially to help prevent your body from getting tired easily.

Focusing on other easy 'one-second' movements is an excellent way to keep your body from getting tired and stiff, especially when you're busy.\n\nHere are a few more simple 'one-second' movements you can try to integrate easily while waiting for orders or at a red light:\n\n1.  **\"Ankle Circles\"**: When you're stopped, gently lift one foot slightly and rotate your ankle in a small circle, one direction then the other. Just one or two circles per ankle can help with circulation and stiffness in your lower legs.\n2.  **\"Finger Wiggle\"**: While holding the handlebars or just resting your hands, quickly wiggle your fingers and thumbs for a second or two. This can help prevent stiffness in your hands and wrists, which are constantly engaged while driving.\n3.  **\"Shoulder Blade Squeeze\"**: When you're seated, gently squeeze your shoulder blades together for just one second, then release. This helps to open up your chest and counteract the hunched posture that can develop from driving.\n\nRemember, the goal is just a quick, gentle movement. No need for a full stretch, just enough to break up the static posture.\n\nWhich of these sounds easiest for you to try first? Or do you want to explore other types of movements?",

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

However, I can give you the most important, easy-to-follow steps for Infant CPR and AED usage, just like you'd see in those short, clear demonstration videos you prefer. This way, you can start learning the core actions right away.\n\nHere are the key steps, broken down simply:\n\n---\n\n**Infant CPR (for babies under 1 year old):**\n\n1.  **Check for Danger, Response, and Breathing:**\n    *   Ensure the area is safe.\n    *   Gently tap the baby's foot or shoulder and call their name. If no response, check for normal breathing (look, listen, feel for no more than 10 seconds).\n    *   If no response and not breathing normally, call for emergency help immediately.\n\n2.  **Position the Baby:**\n    *   Place the baby on a firm, flat surface (like the floor).\n\n3.  **Chest Compressions:**\n    *   Use **two fingers** (index and middle finger) in the center of the baby's chest, just below the nipple line.\n    *   Push down about **1.5 inches (4 cm)** deep.\n    *   Do **30 compressions** at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute (think of the rhythm of \"Stayin' Alive\").\n\n4.  **Rescue Breaths (if trained):**\n    *   After 30 compressions, open the airway by gently tilting the head back slightly and lifting the chin.\n    *   Cover the baby's mouth and nose with your mouth.\n    *   Give **2 gentle puffs** of air, just enough to make the chest rise.\n    *   Each breath should last about 1 second.\n\n5.  **Continue:**\n    *   Keep repeating cycles of **30 compressions and 2 breaths** until help arrives or the baby shows signs of life.\n\n---\n\n**Using an AED on an Infant/Child (for children 1-8 years old, or under 55 lbs):**\n\n*Note: While infant CPR is for babies under 1, AEDs are typically used for children starting from 1 year old. If a baby under 1 needs an AED and child pads aren't available, adult pads can be used, but ensure they don't touch each other.*\n\n1.  **Call for Help & Turn On AED:**\n    *   Ensure emergency services have been called.\n    *   Turn on the AED and follow its voice prompts.\n\n2.  **Attach Pads:**\n    *   If available, use **pediatric pads** (child pads). These deliver a weaker shock.\n    *   Place one pad on the **front of the chest** and the other on the **back** (between the shoulder blades). Make sure they don't touch each other.\n    *   If only adult pads are available, use them, ensuring they don't touch.\n\n3.  **Analyze & Deliver Shock:**\n    *   Ensure no one is touching the child while the AED analyzes the heart rhythm.\n    *   If the AED advises a shock, ensure no one is touching the child, and press the shock button (if semi-automatic).\n    *   If no shock is advised, continue CPR.\n\n4.  **Continue CPR:**\n    *   Immediately resume CPR (30 compressions, 2 breaths) for 2 minutes after a shock or if no shock was advised. The AED will re-analyze after 2 minutes.\n\n---\n\nTo *see* these actions in a video, I highly recommend searching on YouTube for \"Infant CPR Red Cross\" or \"AED for Children St. John Ambulance\". They have excellent, clear, and short demonstration videos that perfectly match what you're looking for.\n\nThis theoretical understanding, combined with your practical session tomorrow, Friday, March 13th, at PMI Jakarta Selatan (1:00 PM - 4:00 PM), will be incredibly powerful. Practicing with the manikin will solidify these steps and build your confidence significantly.\n\nHow do these summarized steps feel to you, Mas?",

Defense declaration: The defending player declares any defense cards they wish to play, such as defense upgrades or special ability cards that increase their planet's defense.\n3. Attack resolution: The attacking player's spaceship and the defending player's planet are compared, and the damage is calculated based on the offensive and defensive strengths of the two cards. If the attacking player's spaceship has a higher offensive strength, the defending player's planet takes damage equal to the difference between the two strengths.\n4. Defense resolution: If the defending player played any defense cards, their effects are resolved. Defense cards can increase the planet's defense strength, reduce the damage taken, or activate special abilities that protect the planet from attack.\n5. Damage calculation: The damage taken by the defending player's planet is subtracted from its health. If the planet's health drops to zero, the defending player loses the game.\nThese are the basic steps for resolving an attack in \"Homeworld\". Players must carefully choose their attacks and defenses, and manage their resources to achieve victory. The game is won by reducing the opponent's planet health to zero, or by forcing the opponent to run out of cards in their deck.",

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers. When designing a card game like \"Homeworld\", there are several mathematical concepts that are important to consider:\n1. Probability: Probability is important in determining the likelihood of certain events happening in the game, such as drawing specific cards or resolving attacks successfully. By understanding the probabilities involved in the game, you can balance the game and make it more fair and enjoyable.\n2. Statistics: Statistics are important in determining the average values of different resources and abilities in the game, and can help you balance the game and make it more fair and enjoyable.\n3. Combinatorics: Combinatorics is the study of counting and arranging objects, and is important in determining the number of different combinations of cards that players can create. This information can help you balance the game and make it more fair and enjoyable.\n4. Optimization: Optimization is the process of finding the best solution to a problem, and is important in determining the best strategies for players to use in the game. By understanding the different strategies that players can use, you can balance the game and make it more fair and enjoyable.\nThese are just a few examples of the mathematical concepts that are important in the design of the gameplay for \"Homeworld\".

Resource generation cards are used to generate energy, ore, or other resources that the player needs to play other cards.\n3. Play offensive cards: If the player has any offensive cards in their hand, they may choose to play them now. Offensive cards are used to improve the offensive strength of their spaceship, making it more powerful in attacks.\n4. Play defensive cards: If the player has any defensive cards in their hand, they may choose to play them now. Defensive cards are used to improve the defensive strength of their planet, making it more difficult for their opponent to attack.\n5. Attack: If the player has a spaceship and energy, they may choose to attack their opponent's planet. The player declares their intention to attack, and selects the spaceship they wish to use. The opponent may play defense cards to protect their planet. The attack is resolved, and the damage is calculated based on the offensive and defensive strengths of the two cards.\n6.

Penting sekali untuk memahami apa yang kita cek untuk kesehatan kita.\n\nMari saya jelaskan 'kolesterol' dan 'asam urat' dengan cara yang mudah dipahami:\n\n**1. Kolesterol:**\n*   **Apa itu?** Kolesterol itu seperti zat lemak yang ada di darah kita. Tubuh kita sebenarnya butuh kolesterol untuk membangun sel-sel yang sehat.\n*   **Masalahnya apa?** Ada kolesterol \"baik\" (HDL) dan \"jahat\" (LDL). Kalau kolesterol \"jahat\" terlalu banyak, bisa menumpuk di pembuluh darah dan menyumbatnya, seperti pipa yang berkarat. Ini bisa meningkatkan risiko penyakit jantung dan stroke.\n*   **Gampangnya:** Bayangkan seperti oli di mesin motor. Kita butuh oli secukupnya biar mesin jalan lancar, tapi kalau oli kotor atau terlalu banyak, bisa bikin mesin rusak.\n\n**2. Asam Urat:**\n*   **Apa itu?** Asam urat adalah zat sisa yang terbentuk saat tubuh kita memecah zat bernama purin (purin ini ada alami di tubuh dan di beberapa makanan).\n*   **Masalahnya apa?** Seharusnya asam urat dibuang lewat ginjal. Tapi kalau terlalu banyak atau ginjal tidak bisa membuangnya dengan baik, asam urat bisa menumpuk. Penumpukan ini bisa membentuk kristal di sendi, menyebabkan nyeri hebat yang disebut asam urat (gout), atau bisa juga membentuk batu ginjal.\n*   **Gampangnya:** Anggap seperti sisa sampah dari makanan. Kalau sedikit, gampang dibuang. Tapi kalau sampahnya menumpuk banyak, bisa bikin saluran pembuangan mampet dan masalah.\n\n**Apakah bagus ikut cek ini?**\nMenurut saya, **bagus sekali** kalau Anda ikut cek ini! Kenapa?\n*   **Deteksi Dini:** Dengan mengetahui kadar kolesterol dan asam urat Anda, kita bisa tahu lebih awal apakah ada potensi masalah kesehatan.\n*   **Pencegahan:** Jika ada yang tinggi, Anda bisa mulai melakukan perubahan kecil dalam gaya hidup atau makanan Anda. Ini bisa membantu mencegah masalah yang lebih serius di kemudian hari.\n*   **Kaitan dengan Keluhan Anda:** Anda pernah cerita sering merasa cepat lelah dan badan pegal. Terkadang, kadar kolesterol atau asam urat yang tidak seimbang bisa berkontribusi pada keluhan tersebut. Dengan cek ini, Anda bisa mendapatkan gambaran lebih jelas tentang kondisi tubuh Anda secara keseluruhan.\n\nJadi, ini adalah langkah proaktif yang baik untuk menjaga kesehatan Anda, apalagi dengan aktivitas Anda yang padat.",

Develop a checklist: Create a checklist of the characteristics you've identified as indicative of a complex property. This checklist should be clear, concise, and easy to follow, and it should include objective criteria that can be consistently applied.\n2. Assign a score: For each characteristic on the checklist, assign a score that reflects the level of complexity the characteristic contributes to the property. For example, you could assign a score of 1 for characteristics that are relatively simple or straightforward, and a score of 5 for characteristics that are highly complex or challenging.\n3. Determine a threshold score: Based on the scores you've assigned, determine a threshold score that indicates when an appraisal order qualifies as complex. This threshold score could be set based on the average score for past appraisal orders, industry standards, or other relevant factors.\n4. Provide clear instructions: Make sure the guidelines are clear and easy to follow, and provide detailed instructions on how to use the checklist and scoring system to determine whether an appraisal order is complex.\n5. Review and adjust: Regularly review and adjust the guidelines as necessary to ensure that they remain relevant and effective. This could involve updating the checklist, changing the threshold score, or making other modifications as needed.\nBy following these steps, you should be able to establish clear and objective guidelines for determining complexity that your team can use consistently. These guidelines will help ensure that your team is able to accurately determine when an appraisal order is complex and request a higher fee when appropriate.",

A research problem is a question, issue, or gap in knowledge that a researcher wants to investigate, explore, or solve. It is the starting point for any research project and helps to guide the entire research process.\nHere are the steps involved in formulating a research problem:\n1. Identify the general research topic: The first step in formulating a research problem is to identify a broad topic of interest that aligns with the research area or field of study. This could be done through a literature review or discussions with experts in the field.\n2. Review the literature: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is essential in identifying existing research on the topic and any gaps in knowledge or understanding. This will help to refine the research question and identify the scope of the research problem.\n3. Identify a research gap or problem: Based on the literature review, identify an area of research that has not been adequately addressed or a gap in knowledge that needs to be explored. This could be a question that arises from existing research or a new direction of research.\n4. Formulate the research problem: Once the research gap or problem has been identified, formulate a clear and concise research problem statement that outlines the key variables, the population under study, and the expected outcomes. The research problem should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).\n5. Refine the research problem: Refine the research problem by seeking feedback from peers, supervisors, or experts in the field. This will help to ensure that the problem is well-defined and aligns with the research area of interest.\nIn summary, formulating a research problem involves identifying a general research topic, conducting a literature review, identifying a research gap or problem, formulating a clear and concise research problem statement, and refining the problem based on feedback. A well-formulated research problem will guide the entire research process and help to ensure that the research outcomes are relevant and significant.",

Identify a research gap or problem: The research gap is the lack of understanding of how positive social media use can impact mental health. The research problem is formulated as: \"What is the impact of positive social media use on mental health among young adults?\"\n3. Formulate the research problem: The research problem is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. It outlines the key variables (positive social media use and mental health), the population under study (young adults), and the expected outcomes (the impact of positive social media use on mental health among young adults).\n4. Refine the research problem: Seek feedback from peers, supervisors, or experts in the field to refine the research problem and ensure that it aligns with the research area of interest.\nOverall, this example demonstrates how to formulate a research problem by identifying a research gap or problem, formulating a clear and concise research problem statement, and refining the problem based on feedback.",

A hypothesis is a statement that suggests a relationship between two or more variables. It is an educated guess or prediction about what the researcher expects to find in their study.\nHere are the steps involved in constructing a hypothesis:\n1. Identify the research problem: The first step in constructing a hypothesis is to identify the research problem that the study will investigate. The research problem should be specific and well-defined.\n2. Review the literature: Conduct a thorough review of the literature to identify previous research on the topic and any relevant theories that can guide the development of the hypothesis.\n3. Identify the variables: Identify the independent and dependent variables that will be studied. The independent variable is the variable that the researcher manipulates or controls in the study, while the dependent variable is the variable that is measured or observed to determine the effect of the independent variable.\n4. Formulate the hypothesis: The hypothesis should be a statement that suggests a relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It should be clear, concise, and testable. The hypothesis should also be based on previous research or relevant theories.\n5. Determine the direction of the hypothesis: The hypothesis can be directional or non-directional. A directional hypothesis suggests the direction of the relationship between the variables, while a non-directional hypothesis does not.\n6. Refine the hypothesis: Seek feedback from peers, supervisors, or experts in the field to refine the hypothesis and ensure that it aligns with the research problem and variables.\nIn summary, constructing a hypothesis involves identifying the research problem, reviewing the literature, identifying the variables, formulating the hypothesis, determining the direction of the hypothesis, and refining the hypothesis based on feedback.

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

You're right, your time is precious, and we'll get straight to it.\n\nHere is the detailed \"mental walkthrough\" for Infant CPR and AED usage, designed to help you visualize each movement clearly, just as you requested:\n\n---\n\n### **Mental Walkthrough: Infant CPR (for babies under 1 year old)**\n\nImagine a baby lying still.\n\n1.  **Check for Danger, Response, and Breathing:**\n    *   First, quickly scan the area around the baby. Is anything unsafe? Move any hazards.\n    *   Gently tap the **bottom of the baby's foot** or softly stroke their shoulder. Call their name or make a soft sound. Look for any movement, crying, or response.\n    *   If no response, immediately look at the baby's chest. Is it rising and falling? Listen closely for breathing sounds. Feel for air on your cheek. Do this for no more than **10 seconds**.\n    *   If the baby is unresponsive and not breathing normally (or only gasping), it's an emergency. **Immediately call for emergency help** or ask someone nearby to do it while you start CPR.\n\n2.  **Position the Baby:**\n    *   Carefully place the baby on a **firm, flat surface**. This is crucial for effective compressions. A floor or a sturdy table is ideal. Ensure their head is level with their body.\n\n3.  **Chest Compressions (The \"Gerakan\" - Movement):**\n    *   Kneel beside the baby.\n    *   Locate the center of the baby's chest. Imagine a line between the baby's nipples. Place **two fingers** (your index and middle finger) on the breastbone, just below this imaginary nipple line.\n    *   Position your fingers so they are perpendicular to the chest. Your other fingers should be lifted off the baby's chest to avoid putting pressure elsewhere.\n    *   Using the pads of your two fingers, push down **straight down** into the chest. Aim for a depth of about **1.5 inches (4 cm)**.\n    *   Compress the chest **30 times** at a steady, fast rhythm – about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Think of the beat of a song like \"Stayin' Alive.\"\n    *   After each compression, allow the chest to **fully recoil** (come back up) before the next compression. Don't lean on the baby's chest.\n\n4.  **Rescue Breaths (if trained):**\n    *   After 30 compressions, gently open the baby's airway. Place one hand on the baby's forehead and gently tilt the head back **just a little bit** (not too far, as an infant's airway is delicate). With your other hand, gently lift the chin.\n    *   Take a normal breath.\n    *   Cover the baby's **mouth and nose completely** with your mouth, creating a seal.\n    *   Give **2 gentle puffs of air**. Each puff should last about 1 second, just enough to make the baby's chest visibly rise. Avoid forceful breaths.\n    *   Watch for the chest to fall after each breath.\n\n5.  **Continue:**\n    *   Immediately resume chest compressions. Keep repeating cycles of **30 compressions and 2 breaths** without interruption.\n    *   Continue until emergency help arrives and takes over, or the baby shows clear signs of life (like crying, moving, or breathing normally).\n\n---\n\n### **Mental Walkthrough: Using an AED on a Child (for children 1-8 years old, or under 55 lbs)**\n\n*Remember: Infant CPR is for babies under 1 year old. AEDs are typically used for children starting from 1 year old. If a baby under 1 needs an AED and child pads aren't available, adult pads can be used, but ensure they don't touch each other.*\n\nImagine a child who is unresponsive and not breathing normally, and emergency services have been called.\n\n1.  **Call for Help & Turn On AED:**\n    *   Ensure emergency services are on their way.\n    *   Grab the AED and immediately **turn it ON**. The AED will start giving you clear voice prompts. Listen carefully to every instruction.\n\n2.  **Attach Pads (The \"Gerakan\" - Movement):**\n    *   If available, use **pediatric (child) pads**. These are smaller and deliver a weaker electrical shock, which is safer for children.\n    *   **Expose the child's chest completely.** Remove any clothing.\n    *   Peel one pad off its backing. Place it on the **front of the child's chest**, usually on the upper right side, just below the collarbone.\n    *   Peel the second pad off. Place it on the **back of the child** (between the shoulder blades), ensuring it does not touch the front pad. This \"sandwich\" placement ensures the electrical current passes through the heart effectively.\n    *   If only adult pads are available, use them, but make sure they **do not touch each other** on the child's body. You might need to place one on the front and one on the back to achieve this.\n    *   Once both pads are firmly attached, **plug the pad connector cable into the AED unit.**\n\n3.  **Analyze & Deliver Shock (The \"Gerakan\" - Movement):**\n    *   The AED will now tell you \"Analyzing heart rhythm. Do not touch the patient.\" **Ensure absolutely no one is touching the child.** Look around and clearly announce, \"Everyone clear!\"\n    *   If the AED detects a shockable rhythm, it will say \"Shock advised. Charging.\"\n    *   Once charged, it will instruct you to \"Press the shock button.\" Again, loudly announce, \"I'm clear, you're clear, everyone's clear!\" and then **press the flashing shock button firmly.**\n    *   The child's body might twitch briefly.\n    *   If the AED advises \"No shock advised,\" it means the heart rhythm doesn't require a shock, or it may advise you to continue CPR.\n\n4.  **Continue CPR:**\n    *   Immediately after a shock (or if no shock was advised), **resume CPR** (30 compressions, 2 breaths) for 2 minutes. Don't delay.\n    *   The AED will re-analyze the heart rhythm after approximately 2 minutes and guide you through the next steps. Continue following its prompts until emergency help arrives.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps you visualize the movements and actions more clearly, Pak.

Your problem isn't understanding *what* to look for, but the actual *process of finding and choosing* the right video, and you need a solution that works for you without wasting your valuable time. You're right, simply explaining my limitations isn't helping you get the videos watched.\n\nYou're asking if there's another way to learn this without you having to search and choose on YouTube. Yes, there is. Since the core challenge is visualizing the movements without the hassle of searching, we can pivot to a different approach:\n\n1.  **Detailed \"Mental Walkthrough\" with Enhanced Visual Descriptions:** I can provide you with a very detailed, step-by-step text description of the Infant CPR and AED movements, almost like a script of what you would see in a video. I will use descriptive language to help you visualize the hand placement, body position, and rhythm, focusing on the \"gerakan\" (movements) you find challenging. This way, the content comes directly to you, and you don't have to search.\n\n2.  **Maximize Your Manikin Practice:** You have a crucial manikin practice session scheduled for **Friday, March 13th, from 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM at PMI Jakarta Selatan.** This is the absolute best way to get hands-on experience and clarify all the movements. We can use our time now to prepare you for that session:\n    *   I can give you specific points to focus on during the manikin practice.\n    *   We can formulate questions for the instructor there, specifically about Infant CPR and AED pad placement, which you've identified as your weaknesses.\n\nWould you like me to start by giving you a more detailed, descriptive text walkthrough of the Infant CPR movements, and then we can discuss how to best prepare for your manikin practice? This way, you get the learning content directly from me without any searching on your part.",

Instead of beating yourself up for feeling embarrassed or ashamed, try to be kind and understanding towards yourself. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay to feel uncomfortable in certain situations.\n2. Challenge your negative thoughts. When you're feeling embarrassed or ashamed, you may have negative thoughts about yourself or the situation. Try to identify these thoughts and challenge them by asking yourself if they are really true. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm a terrible partner for watching porn,\" you could tell yourself \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't define who I am as a person.\"\n3. Communicate openly and honestly. One of the best ways to overcome embarrassment and shame is to communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend. Be upfront about what happened and how you're feeling, and listen to her perspective without becoming defensive. This can help to create a safe and supportive environment for both of you to talk about sensitive topics.\n4. Seek support. If you're struggling to overcome your embarrassment and shame, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with guidance and support to help you work through your emotions and develop healthier ways of dealing with difficult situations.\n5. Take responsibility for your actions. Instead of trying to hide or deny your actions, take responsibility for them. This means acknowledging what you did, apologizing for any harm you may have caused, and making amends if necessary. Taking responsibility can help to build trust and strengthen your relationship.",

Make the app family-friendly: Given that 80% of users visit the park with their family or friends, it is important to design the app in a way that is easy and intuitive for different user segments, including children and seniors.\n3. Cater to international users: Since 20% of users are international, it is important to design the app in a way that is accessible and easy to use for non-native speakers.

          "content": "I understand completely, it's natural to feel a bit unsure how to connect your experience as an ojek driver to a warehouse job. But actually, many of the skills you've developed are highly valuable and transferable to a Warehouse Operator role, especially in a busy e-commerce environment.\n\nLet's break down how your daily work makes you a strong candidate:\n\n1.  **Efficiency and Route Optimization (Knowing Jakarta's routes):** As an ojek driver, you constantly plan the most efficient routes, navigate traffic, and ensure timely deliveries. In a warehouse, this translates to efficiently moving goods, understanding optimal storage layouts, and finding items quickly. Your ability to think spatially and find the best path is a huge asset.\n\n2.  **Handling Deliveries and Inventory (Picking/Packing):** You're used to picking up items, ensuring they are correct, and delivering them safely. This is very similar to a warehouse operator's task of picking specific items from shelves, packing them correctly, and preparing them for shipment. You already have experience with accuracy and careful handling.\n\n3.  **Time Management and Punctuality:** Your job demands you to be on time for pickups and deliveries, often under pressure. Warehouses operate on strict schedules for receiving, processing, and shipping goods. Your punctuality and ability to manage your time effectively are crucial for maintaining workflow and meeting deadlines.\n\n4.  **Diligence and Reliability (Working Long Hours):** You consistently work long hours, showing strong work ethic and reliability. Warehouse roles often require sustained effort and commitment, and your proven diligence as an ojek driver demonstrates you can handle the demands of the job.\n\n5.  **Problem-Solving and Adaptability (Dealing with Traffic/Unexpected Situations):** You face unexpected challenges like traffic jams or difficult customers daily and find solutions on the spot. In a warehouse, this could mean adapting to changes in inventory, equipment issues, or unexpected order surges. Your ability to stay calm under pressure and take initiative is very valuable.\n\n6.  **Safety Awareness:** Navigating Jakarta's roads safely is paramount for you. In a warehouse, safety protocols are critical for handling equipment and goods. Your inherent awareness of safe practices can be easily adapted to a warehouse setting.\n\nThese are all excellent points to highlight in your interview. You're not just an ojek driver; you're a logistics coordinator, a problem-solver, and a reliable operator on two wheels.\n\nDoes this help you see the connections more clearly? We can practice how to phrase these experiences for the interview.",

          "content": "Model creation is the next step after data preparation in Keras. Here are the basic steps to create a model in Keras:\n1. Import the required modules: You'll need to import the necessary modules from Keras to create and train your model. This typically includes `keras.models` to create the model, and `keras.layers` to define the layers of the model.\n2. Create a Sequential model: Keras provides several ways to create models, but the simplest is the Sequential model, which is a linear stack of layers. You can create a Sequential model by calling `Sequential()` from `keras.models`.\n3. Add layers to the model: You'll need to define the layers of the model and add them to the Sequential model. Keras provides a wide range of layer types, including Dense, Conv2D, LSTM, and more. You can add layers to the model using the `add()` method of the Sequential model.\n4. Compile the model: Before training the model, you need to compile it by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics. The optimizer determines how the model is updated based on the training data, the loss function measures how well the model is performing on the training data, and the metrics provide additional evaluation metrics during training. You can compile the model using the `compile()` method of the Sequential model.\n5. Train the model: Once the model is compiled, you can train it using the `fit()` method of the Sequential model. You'll need to specify the training data, validation data (optional), batch size, number of epochs, and other parameters.\n6. Evaluate the model: After training, you can evaluate the performance of the model on the testing data using the `evaluate()` method of the Sequential model.\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to create a simple neural network model in Keras:\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\n# Create a Sequential model\nmodel = Sequential()\n# Add a dense layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation\nmodel.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)))\n# Add another dense layer with 32 neurons and ReLU activation\nmodel.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))\n# Add a final dense layer with output size 1 (for binary classification) and sigmoid activation\nmodel.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n# Compile the model with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer\nmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n# Train the model on the training data\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))\n# Evaluate the model on the testing data\nloss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)\nprint('Test loss:', loss)\nprint('Test accuracy:', accuracy)\n```\nIn this code, we create a Sequential model with three dense layers, compile it with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer, train it on the training data, and evaluate it on the testing data. Note that this is just a simple example, and the exact architecture of the model will depend on the specific problem you're trying to solve.",

          "content": "A single-phase fully controlled bridge converter with a highly inductive load can operate in two modes: rectifying mode and inversion mode.\ni) Rectifying Mode:\nIn the rectifying mode, the input AC voltage is applied to the load through the bridge converter. The converter consists of four thyristors, which are triggered in pairs to provide a unidirectional current flow through the load.\nDuring the positive half-cycle of the input voltage, thyristors T1 and T2 are triggered, and they conduct, allowing the current to flow through the load. The load is highly inductive, so the current lags the voltage by a significant phase angle. The thyristors remain on until the current through them drops to zero, at which point they turn off.\nDuring the negative half-cycle of the input voltage, thyristors T3 and T4 are triggered, and they conduct, allowing the current to continue flowing through the load in the same direction. The thyristors remain on until the current through them drops to zero, at which point they turn off.\nii) Inversion Mode:\nIn the inversion mode, the input DC voltage is applied to the load through the bridge converter. The converter operates in the same way as in the rectifying mode, but the polarity of the output voltage is reversed.\nDuring the positive half-cycle of the input voltage, thyristors T2 and T3 are triggered, and they conduct, allowing the current to flow through the load in the opposite direction. The thyristors remain on until the current through them drops to zero, at which point they turn off.\nDuring the negative half-cycle of the input voltage, thyristors T1 and T4 are triggered, and they conduct, allowing the current to continue flowing through the load in the same direction. The thyristors remain on until the current through them drops to zero, at which point they turn off.\nIn both modes, the load current is highly inductive, so it takes time for the current to rise and fall through zero. This means that the thyristors must remain on for a significant part of each half-cycle of the input voltage to avoid large voltage spikes across the load. This results in a significant amount of harmonic distortion in the output voltage and current, which can cause problems in some applications. To mitigate this, various filtering techniques can be used, such as a passive LC filter or an active power factor correction circuit.",

          "content": "In a single-phase full converter, the input AC voltage is converted to a DC voltage using a bridge configuration of four thyristors. The converter is used to drive a load, which may be resistive or inductive. The performance of the converter is affected by the source inductance, which is the inductance of the AC supply source.\nThe effect of source inductance on the performance of the single-phase full converter can be explained as follows:\n1. Voltage drop across thyristors: When a thyristor is conducting, there is a voltage drop across it due to its forward resistance. This voltage drop is proportional to the current flowing through the thyristor. In the presence of source inductance, the current through the thyristor does not change instantaneously when it is turned on or off. This is because the inductance opposes changes in current. As a result, the voltage drop across the thyristor is higher than it would be in the absence of source inductance. This can lead to a reduction in the converter's output voltage.\n2. Turn-on time of thyristors: The turn-on time of a thyristor is the time it takes for the thyristor to switch from its off state to its on state. This time is affected by the gate current, the gate-cathode voltage, and the rate of rise of the anode-cathode voltage. In the presence of source inductance, the rate of rise of the anode-cathode voltage is reduced due to the inductance of the source. This can increase the turn-on time of the thyristor, leading to higher switching losses.\n3. Current waveform distortion: The presence of source inductance can cause distortion in the current waveform of the converter. This is because the inductance causes the current to rise and fall more slowly, leading to a longer conduction time for the thyristors. This can lead to higher levels of harmonic distortion in the output voltage and current, which can cause problems in some applications.\nTo mitigate the effects of source inductance, various techniques can be used. One approach is to use a filter circuit to reduce the level of harmonic distortion in the output waveform. Another approach is to use a control strategy that takes into account the effects of source inductance, such as a current-controlled or voltage-controlled converter. In some cases, it may also be possible to reduce the source inductance by using a different transformer or by adding a capacitor bank to the input circuit.",

Imagine this as your audio guide, focusing on the actions.\n\nHere are the steps for **Infant CPR (for babies under 1 year old)**:\n\n1.  **Check for Danger, Response, and Breathing:**\n    *   First, quickly **scan the area** around the baby. Is it safe for you to approach? Look for anything that could cause further harm.\n    *   Next, gently **tap the baby's foot or shoulder** and softly call their name. You're looking for any movement or sound.\n    *   If there's no response, **look, listen, and feel for breathing** for no more than 10 seconds. Place your ear near their mouth and nose, look at their chest for movement. Is it normal breathing?\n    *   If there's no response and they're not breathing normally (or not breathing at all), immediately **call for emergency help**. Shout for someone to call 112 or your local emergency number, or if you're alone, you'll need to do CPR for 2 minutes before calling.\n\n2.  **Position the Baby:**\n    *   Carefully place the baby on a **firm, flat surface**. This is crucial for effective compressions. Think of the floor, or a sturdy table.\n\n3.  **Chest Compressions:**\n    *   Now, locate the spot for compressions. Use **two fingers** – your index and middle finger – and place them in the **center of the baby's chest**, just below the nipple line.\n    *   Push down about **1.5 inches (4 cm) deep**. This is roughly one-third of the chest depth.\n    *   Perform **30 compressions** at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. Try to keep a steady rhythm, like the beat of the song \"Stayin' Alive.\" Make sure to let the chest fully recoil after each compression.\n\n4.  **Rescue Breaths (if trained):**\n    *   After 30 compressions, you'll give breaths. Gently **open the airway** by slightly tilting the baby's head back and lifting their chin.\n    *   Take a normal breath, then **cover the baby's mouth and nose with your mouth**, creating a seal.\n    *   Give **2 gentle puffs of air**, just enough to make the baby's chest visibly rise. Each puff should last about 1 second. Avoid blowing too hard.\n\n5.  **Continue:**\n    *   Keep repeating these cycles: **30 compressions, then 2 breaths**. Continue without interruption until emergency help arrives and takes over, or until the baby shows clear signs of life, like crying or moving.\n\nRemember, the key is to stay calm and follow these steps. You're doing great by reviewing this on the go! Let me know if you want to go over any part again, or if you're ready for AED usage next.",

          "content": "Oke, siap! Let's jump right into the steps for **AED usage**, perfect for reviewing while you're waiting for orders. This will be your audio guide, focusing on the actions and what you'll hear from the device itself.\n\nRemember, an AED is typically used for children starting from 1 year old. If a baby under 1 needs an AED and child pads aren't available, adult pads can be used, but ensure they don't touch each other.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1.  **Call for Help & Turn On AED:**\n    *   First, make sure emergency services (like 112) have been called.\n    *   Then, **turn on the AED**. Most AEDs have a clear \"ON\" button.\n    *   Once on, the AED will immediately start giving you **voice prompts**. Listen carefully to these instructions, as the device will guide you through the process.\n\n2.  **Attach Pads:**\n    *   The AED will tell you to expose the child's chest. Quickly **tear open the pad package**.\n    *   If available, use **pediatric pads** (child pads). These are smaller and deliver a weaker shock, which is safer for children.\n    *   Look at the diagrams on the pads themselves. You'll typically place **one pad on the front of the child's chest** (usually on the upper right side) and the **other pad on their back**, between the shoulder blades.\n    *   **Crucially, make sure the pads do not touch each other.** If they do, the shock won't be effective.\n    *   If only adult pads are available, use them, but still ensure they don't touch each other.\n\n3.  **Analyze & Deliver Shock:**\n    *   Once the pads are attached, the AED will instruct everyone to **\"Stand Clear!\"** or **\"Don't Touch the Patient!\"**\n    *   **Ensure absolutely no one is touching the child** while the AED analyzes their heart rhythm. This is vital for the AED to get an accurate reading.\n    *   If the AED detects a shockable rhythm, it will advise a shock. It might say something like **\"Shock Advised. Stand Clear!\"**\n    *   If it advises a shock, make one last verbal confirmation: **\"Everyone clear!\"** Then, if it's a semi-automatic AED, **press the flashing shock button**. If it's fully automatic, it will deliver the shock on its own.\n    *   If no shock is advised (e.g., \"No Shock Advised\"), the AED will tell you to continue CPR.\n\n4.  **Continue CPR:**\n    *   Immediately after a shock is delivered, or if no shock was advised, **resume CPR without delay**.\n    *   Go straight back to your cycles of **30 compressions and 2 breaths**.\n    *   Continue CPR for **2 minutes**. The AED will have an internal timer and will usually prompt you to stop and re-analyze after this 2-minute period.\n\nThe key with an AED is to listen to its voice prompts and follow them exactly. It's designed to be used by anyone, even without extensive training.\n\nHow does that sound for the AED steps? We can go over any part again if you like, or you can let me know when you're ready to move on.",

Agricultural lands:\n\t* Croplands: 50 to 200 gC/m²/yr\n\t* Agroforestry systems: 100 to 600 gC/m²/yr\n\t* Perennial crops (e.g., fruit trees, oil palm): 100 to 500 gC/m²/yr\n4. Wetlands:\n\t* Peatlands: 10 to 200 gC/m²/yr\n\t* Mangroves: 300 to 1,500 gC/m²/yr\nPlease note that these values are approximate and can vary depending on factors such as species composition, age of the vegetation, soil type, and climate. Management practices, such as tillage, irrigation, and fertilization, can also significantly influence the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural lands.\nFor field crops like wheat, carbon sequestration values are typically on the lower end of the range for croplands (50 to 200 gC/m²/yr). However, these values can be enhanced by adopting sustainable agricultural practices like conservation tillage, cover cropping, and crop rotation, which promote soil carbon storage and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",

In other words, the number of cells in the organ is determined by both the original number of stem cells and the rate at which cells are replaced over time.

The cell turnover rate (t) could be estimated from the literature or from experimental measurements.\nNext, one could use the equation N = M + (t × C) to calculate the number of cells in the organ (N) for different values of time (t), assuming that the number of stem cells remains constant over time. One could then plot the resulting values of N against time, to obtain a curve that represents the expected number of cells in the organ over time.\nBy examining this hazard curve, one could estimate the risk of disease or dysfunction associated with changes in the number of stem cells. For example, if the curve shows that the number of cells in the organ is expected to fall below the necessary amount for proper function (C) after a certain period of time, this could indicate an increased risk of disease or dysfunction. The shape of the hazard curve could also provide information on the rate at which the risk increases over time.\nIt's important to note that constructing a hazard curve for a specific organ is a complex task that requires careful consideration of many factors, including the specific cell types involved, the mechanisms of cell turnover and regeneration, and the presence of any disease or damage.

The parameters p and t represent the rates of stem cell proliferation and differentiation, respectively, while d represents the rate of cell death and m represents the rate of cell mutation.

In this exercise, you will practice using control flow statements in Python to process banking data and extract useful information.\n### Objective\nWrite a Python program that reads in a CSV file containing banking transaction data and uses control flow statements to process the data and identify transactions that meet certain criteria.\n### Steps\n1. Download the sample banking transaction data from [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/banking_data.csv), where `username` should be replaced with your GitHub username.\n2. Use the `pandas` library to read the CSV file into a DataFrame.\n3. Write a function that takes a DataFrame as input and uses control flow statements (e.g., `if`, `else`) to identify transactions that meet the following criteria:\n\t* Transactions with a value greater than $10,000\n\t* Transactions that occurred on a weekend\n\t* Transactions that occurred in the past week\n4. Print out the number of transactions that meet each of the above criteria.\n### Example Solution\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\ndef process_transactions(df):\n    # Transactions with a value greater than $10,000\n    high_value = df[df['Value'] > 10000]\n    # Transactions that occurred on a weekend\n    weekend = df[df['Date'].apply(lambda x: x.weekday() in [5, 6])]\n    # Transactions that occurred in the past week\n    week_ago = datetime.today() - timedelta(days=7)\n    past_week = df[df['Date'] >= week_ago]\n    # Print out the number of transactions that meet each of the above criteria\n    print(f\"Number of transactions with a value greater than $10,000: {len(high_value)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of transactions that occurred on a weekend: {len(weekend)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of transactions that occurred in the past week: {len(past_week)}\")\n# Read in the CSV file\ndf = pd.read_csv('banking_data.csv')\n# Process the transactions\nprocess_transactions(df)\n```\n### Expected Output\n```javascript\nNumber of transactions with a value greater than $10,000: 2\nNumber of transactions that occurred on a weekend: 3\nNumber of transactions that occurred in the past week: 4\n```\nIn this exercise, learners will practice using control flow statements in Python to process banking data and extract useful information. They will gain experience in using the `pandas` library to read and manipulate CSV files, and in writing Python functions to automate data processing tasks.",

Not knowing the company's policies on sick leave or emergency family leave definitely adds to the uncertainty, and it's perfectly normal to feel that way.\n\nTo clarify, 'emergency family leave' is essentially a company policy that allows employees to take time off work to attend to urgent family matters, such as a child's sudden illness or an accident, without losing their job or facing severe penalties. It often comes with specific conditions regarding pay (paid or unpaid) and how much notice you need to give.\n\nSince this information is crucial for your decision, the best next step would be to find out about these policies directly. Would you feel comfortable reaching out to the HR department or the recruiter who extended the offer to ask about their specific policies on:\n1.  **Employee Sick Leave:** How many days are provided, and what is the process for taking it?\n2.  **Emergency Family Leave:** Do they have a policy for when a child gets sick, and what are the terms (e.g., paid/unpaid, how to request)?\n\nYou could also check if these details are outlined in the job offer letter or any accompanying documents they might have sent. Knowing these specifics will give you a much clearer picture and help you weigh the pros and cons more accurately.\n\nWhat do you think about reaching out to them for this information?",

          "content": "Aspiring to work in the healthcare industry in British Columbia, Canada, and want to apply for the Health Authority stream of the BC Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP)? You've come to the right place! In this comprehensive guide, we will take you through the process of applying for the Health Authority stream of the BC PNP, step-by-step.\nStep 1: Find a Job in a B.C. Health Authority\nTo apply for the Health Authority stream of the BC PNP, you must have a job offer from a B.C. public health authority. The following are the health authorities in B.C.:\n- Provincial Health Services Authority\n- First Nations Health Authority\n- Fraser Health\n- Interior Health\n- Island Health\n- Northern Health\n- Vancouver Coastal Health\n- Providence Health Care\nIf you are a physician, nurse practitioner, or midwife who is not directly employed by a B.C. public health authority, you may also be eligible to apply under the Health Authority stream.\nStep 2: Ensure Your Job Offer is Eligible\nYour job offer may be in any occupation, at any NOC TEER category, with a B.C. public health authority. If you are working in an occupation that is eligible under BC PNP Tech, your job offer does not have to be indeterminate. However, if you are applying under the Health Authority stream, your job offer must be indeterminate, meaning that it must not be temporary or have a defined end date. Additionally, the job offer must be for full-time employment, which the BC PNP defines as at least an average of 30 hours per week, year-round.\nThe B.C. health authority offering you a job must provide you with a signed job offer on official letterhead that meets the following requirements:\n- For an occupation that is eligible under the stream you selected\n- Signed and dated by a B.C. employee or owner of the company who is authorized to hire employees\n- Signed and dated by you confirming that you accept the job offer\n- For a job in B.C.\nStep 3: Meet the Eligibility Criteria\nIn addition to having a valid job offer, you must meet the following eligibility criteria to apply under the Health Authority stream of the BC PNP:\n- You must be qualified for the offered position, meaning you must meet the education, training, experience, and qualifications outlined by the public health authority.\n- Language proficiency requirements depend on the NOC level of the job offered. NOC TEER 2,3, and 5 jobs require a minimum CLB 4 proficiency in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. NOC TEER 0-1 jobs do not require language test results, but submitting valid results may increase your registration score. Accepted language proficiency tests include IELTS, CELPIP, TEF, and TCF, and test results are valid for two years from the date of issuance.\n- Your employer must meet the employer requirements listed in he BC PNP Program Guide.\n- If you are using the Express Entry BC (EEBC) option, you must have a valid IRCC Express Entry Profile Number and a Job Seeker Validation Code, which indicate that you meet the eligibility criteria for one of the federal economic immigration programs subject to IRCC’s Express Entry system. Please note that only occupations classified under NOC TEER 0, 1, 2 or 3 are eligible for consideration under the EEBC option. For more information, see Part 5 of the BC PNP Program Guide.\nStep 4: Submit Your Application\nOnce you have ensured that you meet the eligibility criteria and have all the required documents, you can submit your application to the BC PNP. The application process includes submitting an online application, paying the application fee, and providing all the required documents.\nConclusion\nApplying for the Health Authority stream of the BC PNP requires a job offer from a B.C. public health authority, meeting the eligibility criteria, and submitting a complete application. By following the steps outlined in this comprehensive guide, you can increase your chances of success in applying for this program. Good luck!",

Maybe do a test run during peak hours if you can, so you're not stressed on the first day.\n    *   **Dress Code:** Understand the company's dress code. If you're unsure, it's usually safer to dress a bit more formally on the first day.\n\n2.  **Administrative & Documentation:**\n    *   **Review Offer Letter & Contract:** Read through all the details of your offer letter and employment contract one last time.\n    *   **Required Documents:** Prepare any necessary documents they might need (e.g., KTP, NPWP, educational certificates, bank account details for salary).\n    *   **Benefits & Policies:** This is where our previous discussion comes in handy. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the company's policies on **Employee Sick Leave** and **Emergency Family Leave**. If you haven't received definitive answers yet, now is the time to follow up, as you've accepted the offer. Knowing these details will give you peace of mind, especially with your family in mind.\n\n3.  **Professional & Mental Preparation:**\n    *   **Learn About the Company:** Do a bit of research on the company's recent news, projects, or values. This can help you understand their culture better.\n    *   **Set Expectations:** Understand that the first few weeks are for learning. Don't be afraid to ask questions and take notes.\n    *   **Meet Your Team:** If possible, try to learn a bit about your new team members or manager before you start.\n\nIs there any specific area you'd like to focus on first, or perhaps something you're feeling most unsure about?",

Many simple tasks can be done at home without special tools, significantly cutting down on workshop visits.\n\nHere are some easy, cost-saving maintenance tasks you can do yourself for your Honda Beat:\n\n1.  **Check and Top Up Engine Oil:** This is crucial. Low or dirty oil can severely damage your engine.\n    *   **How to:** Locate the dipstick (usually near the engine). Unscrew it, wipe it clean, reinsert it without screwing, then pull it out again to check the oil level. The oil should be between the min and max marks. If it's low, top it up with the correct type of oil for your Honda Beat (check your owner's manual).\n    *   **Savings:** Prevents costly engine repairs and extends engine life.\n\n2.  **Check Tire Pressure:** Correct tire pressure improves fuel efficiency, extends tire life, and enhances safety.\n    *   **How to:** Use a tire pressure gauge (they're inexpensive). Check the recommended pressure in your owner's manual or on a sticker near the tire valve/swingarm. Inflate or deflate as needed.\n    *   **Savings:** Saves on fuel and delays tire replacement costs.\n\n3.  **Clean or Replace Air Filter:** A clogged air filter reduces engine performance and fuel efficiency.\n    *   **How to:** Locate the air filter box (usually on the side of the scooter). Open it, remove the filter. If it's a foam filter, you might be able to clean it with soap and water, dry it thoroughly, and re-oil it (check manual). If it's a paper filter, it's usually best to just replace it when dirty.\n    *   **Savings:** Improves fuel economy and engine longevity.\n\n4.  **Check Brake Fluid Level (if applicable) and Brake Pad Wear:** Safe brakes are non-negotiable.\n    *   **How to:** For disc brakes, check the fluid level in the reservoir on your handlebar. It should be between the min and max lines. For brake pads, visually inspect them; if the friction material is very thin (less than a few millimeters), they need replacement.\n    *   **Savings:** Prevents brake system failures and more expensive repairs, ensures safety.\n\n5.  **Check and Adjust Chain Tension (if applicable - though Honda Beat is usually belt-driven):** If your model has a chain, proper tension is vital.\n    *   **How to:** (For chain-driven bikes) Check the slack in the chain. It should have a specific amount of play (check manual). Adjust if too loose or too tight.\n    *   **Savings:** Extends chain and sprocket life, prevents breakdowns.\n\n6.  **Lubricate Moving Parts:** Keep cables (throttle, brake) and pivot points (lever, stand) smooth.\n    *   **How to:** Use a multi-purpose lubricant spray. Apply sparingly to ensure smooth operation.\n    *   **Savings:** Prevents parts from seizing, extends component life.\n\nThese are great starting points because they are relatively simple, require minimal tools, and have a direct impact on your motor's health and your wallet.\n\nWhich of these sounds like something you'd like to tackle first, or would you like more detail on any specific one?",

          "content": "Wah, that's great to hear! It's fantastic that you're feeling empowered to tackle more of these tasks yourself. And yes, changing your own engine oil and filter for your Honda Beat is definitely something you can do, and it will save you a significant amount compared to workshop costs! It's one of the most common and impactful DIY maintenance tasks.\n\nYou're right, a clogged or dirty oil filter can be just as problematic as old oil.\n\nHere's what you'll typically need and the basic steps to change the engine oil and filter on your Honda Beat:\n\n**What You'll Need:**\n\n1.  **New Engine Oil:** This is crucial. Check your Honda Beat's owner's manual for the recommended oil type (e.g., SAE 10W-30, JASO MB) and capacity (usually around 0.6 to 0.8 liters for most Honda Beats). Always use motorcycle-specific oil.\n2.  **New Oil Filter (if applicable):** Many automatic scooters like the Honda Beat use a screen-type oil filter that is typically cleaned and reused, rather than a disposable cartridge filter. However, some models might have a small paper filter. Check your manual or visually inspect it first. If it's a reusable screen, you'll just need to clean it. If it's a disposable paper filter, you'll need a new one.\n3.  **Wrench/Socket Set:** You'll need the correct size wrench or socket for the drain plug (usually 12mm or 17mm, but check your specific model).\n4.  **Drain Pan/Container:** To catch the old oil. Make sure it's large enough for the full oil capacity.\n5.  **Funnel:** To pour the new oil without spilling.\n6.  **Rags or Shop Towels:** For cleaning up spills.\n7.  **Gloves:** To keep your hands clean.\n8.  **New Drain Plug Washer (Optional but Recommended):** The small crush washer on the drain plug can sometimes deform and leak if reused too many times. It's cheap to replace and prevents leaks.\n9.  **Torque Wrench (Optional but Recommended):** To tighten the drain plug to the correct specification, preventing overtightening (which can strip threads) or undertightening (which can cause leaks).\n\n**Basic Steps (Always refer to your Honda Beat's owner's manual for exact specifications and procedures):**\n\n1.  **Warm Up the Engine:** Run the engine for a few minutes (about 5-10 minutes) to warm the oil. Warm oil drains more easily and carries out more contaminants.\n2.  **Locate Drain Plug:** Park your scooter on a level surface, preferably on its center stand. The oil drain plug is usually located at the bottom of the engine casing.\n3.  **Prepare for Draining:** Place the drain pan directly under the drain plug.\n4.  **Remove Drain Plug:** Using your wrench, carefully loosen and remove the drain plug. Be careful, the oil might be hot. Let all the old oil drain completely. This can take 5-10 minutes.\n5.  **Clean/Replace Oil Filter:**\n    *   While the oil is draining, locate the oil filter cover (if applicable, often a small cover near the drain plug).\n    *   Remove the cover and take out the filter.\n    *   If it's a reusable screen filter, clean it thoroughly with gasoline or parts cleaner and let it dry.\n    *   If it's a disposable paper filter, replace it with a new one.\n    *   Reinstall the cleaned/new filter and cover, making sure any O-rings are correctly seated.\n6.  **Reinstall Drain Plug:** Once the oil has finished draining, clean the drain plug and the area around the drain hole. Install the new crush washer (if using one) onto the drain plug, then screw the drain plug back in by hand to avoid cross-threading. Tighten it with your wrench to the specified torque (check your manual – usually not excessively tight, just snug).\n7.  **Add New Oil:** Remove the oil filler cap (usually on the side or top of the engine). Place the funnel into the filler hole and slowly pour in the new, recommended engine oil. Pour in slightly less than the full capacity first.\n8.  **Check Oil Level:** After pouring, wait a few minutes for the oil to settle. Use the dipstick (as you would for checking) to ensure the oil level is between the min and max marks. Add more oil gradually if needed until it's at the correct level.\n9.  **Start Engine and Check for Leaks:** Start the engine and let it run for a minute or two. Turn it off, wait a moment, and re-check the oil level. Also, visually inspect around the drain plug and filter cover for any leaks.\n10. **Dispose of Old Oil:** This is very important! Do not pour old oil down the drain. Collect it in a sealed container and take it to an auto parts store or a local recycling center that accepts used motor oil.\n\nIt might seem like a lot of steps, but once you do it once, you'll see how straightforward it is. The most important things are using the correct oil, not overtightening the drain plug, and proper disposal of the old oil.\n\nDoes this list give you a good starting point? Are there any of these items you'd like more detail on?",

According to this model, individuals' gender schemas consist of two components: their personal gender identity (their own gender) and their gender stereotypes (beliefs about the typical characteristics and behaviors associated with males and females).\nBem suggests that these gender schemas influence how individuals perceive and process information in gender-relevant domains, such as occupations, hobbies, and emotions. Individuals with a high degree of gender schematicity are more likely to notice, remember, and prioritize information that is consistent with their gender schema, while ignoring or devaluing information that is inconsistent with their schema.\nFor example, an individual who identifies as male and holds strong gender stereotypes about masculinity may be more likely to remember and value information about male-dominated occupations and activities, while ignoring or devaluing information about traditionally feminine activities or emotions.\nBem's sex-typed lens model suggests that gender schemas can influence a wide range of cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, and interpretation, and can lead to gender-typed behavior, attitudes, and preferences.\nOverall, Bem's sex-typed lens model emphasizes the importance of considering individuals' personal gender identity and gender stereotypes in understanding how they perceive and process gender-relevant information.\nReference:\nBem, S.

          "content": "Sure, here are some interview questions and answers based on the job description and the \"SHE\" criteria:\nQuestion: Can you tell us about a time when you had to work with cross-functional teams to deliver a product or project?\nAnswer: Sure. In my previous role, I worked with the engineering, design, and marketing teams to launch a new feature on our platform. I collaborated with each team to understand their needs and requirements, translated the product strategy into detailed requirements and prototypes, and ensured that the finished product met the criteria. Throughout the process, I held daily briefings with the team to review progress and set priorities, and acted as a product evangelist to build awareness and understanding amongst the team.\nQuestion: How do you prioritize activities based on business and customer impact?\nAnswer: When prioritizing activities, I first assess the potential business impact and customer value of each item on the roadmap. I then use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data, such as user feedback, market research, and revenue projections, to rank the items in order of importance. I also consider the technical feasibility and resource requirements of each activity, and collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure alignment.\nQuestion: Can you give an example of a time when you had to take responsibility for a product or project?\nAnswer: Absolutely. In my previous role, I was leading the product development team on a new feature release, and during the final stages of development, a critical bug was discovered. I took immediate responsibility for the situation and worked with the engineering team to diagnose and fix the issue. I also communicated proactively with the wider team and stakeholders to manage expectations and mitigate any potential impact on the launch timeline. In the end, we were able to successfully launch the feature with minimal disruption.\nQuestion: How do you stay up to date with industry trends and new technologies?\nAnswer: I regularly read industry publications and attend relevant conferences and events to stay informed about the latest trends and technologies. I also actively participate in online communities and forums, such as Product Hunt and Reddit, to learn from other professionals in the field. Additionally, I make a point to continuously learn and improve my skillset by taking part in ongoing training and education programs.",

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

Tackle categories, not rooms: Kondo suggests starting with a specific category of items, such as clothes or books, rather than tackling an entire room. This can make the process of clearing sentimental items feel less overwhelming.\n2. Touch each item: Kondo suggests physically handling each item and asking yourself if it sparks joy. If it does not, it may be time to let it go.\n3. Respect the emotions attached to items: Kondo recognizes that sentimental items can hold strong emotions, and suggests approaching the process of letting them go with kindness and understanding.\n4. Store items properly: Kondo suggests storing items properly, such as folding clothes and stacking books vertically, to help maintain a clutter-free home.\n5. Find a new home for items: Kondo suggests finding a new home for items that do not spark joy, such as donating them to charity or passing them on to a friend.\nKondo's approach to clearing sentimental items emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the emotions attached to the items and approaching the process with a sense of respect and understanding.

A mental health professional can provide support and guidance through this process.\n2. Address underlying trauma: If there is a connection between difficulty in letting go of items and trauma, it may be helpful to address this trauma with the support of a mental health professional. This can help to understand and resolve the underlying emotions that are preventing the person from letting go of the items.\n3. Create a safe and supportive environment: The process of letting go of sentimental items can be difficult and emotional. A mental health professional can create a safe and supportive environment to help the person feel comfortable and supported as they work through this process.\n4. Explore the emotional significance of items: The person may be holding onto items because they hold emotional significance. A mental health professional can help the person explore these emotions and understand why they are having difficulty letting go of the items.\n5. Practice mindfulness and self-compassion: Mindfulness and self-compassion can be helpful in managing the emotions that arise during the process of letting go of sentimental items. A mental health professional can teach techniques for incorporating these practices into daily life.\nUltimately, the approach recommended by a psychiatrist or psychologist specializing in clutter will depend on the individual and their specific situation.

          "content": "Siap, Mas! Senang sekali dengar Anda makin semangat. Betul sekali, kalau bisa kerjakan sendiri, pasti lebih hemat dan motor juga terawat.\n\nKarena Anda sudah siap untuk langkah berikutnya dan ingin melihat demonstrasi, saya akan pandu Anda dengan **\"Mental Walkthrough\"** yang detail, seperti Anda sedang menonton video langkah demi langkah. Ini akan membantu Anda membayangkan setiap gerakan dengan jelas, seperti yang Anda inginkan.\n\nMari kita mulai proses ganti oli mesin Honda Beat Anda:\n\n---\n\n**Panduan Langkah Demi Langkah Ganti Oli Mesin Honda Beat (Mental Walkthrough)**\n\nBayangkan ini seperti video demonstrasi yang jelas dan mudah diikuti:\n\n**Persiapan Awal:**\n\n1.  **Siapkan Semua Alat**: Pastikan semua alat yang sudah kita bahas (kunci pas/ring, wadah bekas, corong, kain lap, oli baru) sudah ada di dekat Anda.\n2.  **Hangatkan Mesin (Sebentar Saja)**: Nyalakan motor Anda sebentar, sekitar 1-2 menit, lalu matikan. Ini membuat oli sedikit lebih encer dan mudah keluar.\n3.  **Posisikan Motor**: Letakkan motor di permukaan yang rata dan stabil. Kalau ada standar tengah, gunakan standar tengah agar motor tidak miring dan Anda punya ruang kerja yang cukup.\n\n**Langkah-Langkah Pengurasan Oli Lama:**\n\n1.  **Cari Baut Pembuangan Oli**:\n    *   Lihat ke bagian bawah mesin motor Anda, biasanya di dekat roda belakang atau di bagian bawah karter mesin.\n    *   Anda akan melihat sebuah baut yang menonjol, ini adalah baut pembuangan oli. Ukurannya biasanya 12 mm atau 17 mm.\n    *   *Visualisasikan*: Baut ini posisinya menghadap ke bawah atau sedikit ke samping.\n\n2.  **Siapkan Wadah Oli Kotor**:\n    *   Letakkan wadah bekas yang sudah Anda siapkan (ember kecil atau botol potongan) tepat di bawah baut pembuangan oli. Pastikan posisinya pas agar oli tidak tumpah ke mana-mana.\n\n3.  **Buka Baut Pembuangan Oli**:\n    *   Ambil kunci pas/ring yang sesuai ukurannya.\n    *   Putar baut pembuangan oli berlawanan arah jarum jam (kiri) untuk mengendurkannya.\n    *   Setelah kendur, Anda bisa melanjutkan memutar dengan tangan.\n    *   *Penting*: Hati-hati, oli akan langsung keluar dan mungkin masih agak panas. Biarkan oli mengalir sepenuhnya sampai tetesan terakhir. Ini bisa memakan waktu beberapa menit.\n\n4.  **Periksa Filter Oli (Saringan Kasar)**:\n    *   Pada beberapa motor Honda Beat, baut pembuangan oli ini juga sekaligus menahan saringan kasar (filter oli). Jika ada, saringan ini akan ikut keluar bersama baut.\n    *   *Jika ada*: Bersihkan saringan ini dari kotoran atau serpihan logam menggunakan kain lap. Pastikan bersih.\n    *   *Jika tidak ada*: Tidak masalah, lanjutkan ke langkah berikutnya.\n\n5.  **Pasang Kembali Baut Pembuangan Oli**:\n    *   Setelah oli benar-benar habis, pasang kembali saringan kasar (jika ada) dan baut pembuangan oli.\n    *   Kencangkan baut searah jarum jam (kanan) menggunakan kunci pas/ring.\n    *   *Penting*: Kencangkan secukupnya saja, jangan terlalu kuat (over-tight) karena bisa merusak drat baut atau karter mesin. Cukup sampai terasa kokoh dan tidak longgar.\n\n**Langkah-Langkah Pengisian Oli Baru:**\n\n1.  **Cari Tutup Pengisian Oli**:\n    *   Lihat ke bagian atas mesin, biasanya di dekat area CVT atau di sisi kanan mesin.\n    *   Anda akan menemukan sebuah tutup yang bisa diputar, seringkali memiliki stik pengukur oli (dipstick) yang menyatu. Ini adalah tutup pengisian oli.\n    *   Putar tutup ini berlawanan arah jarum jam untuk membukanya.\n\n2.  **Gunakan Corong**:\n    *   Masukkan corong sederhana yang sudah Anda siapkan ke lubang pengisian oli. Ini sangat membantu agar oli tidak tumpah.\n\n3.  **Tuangkan Oli Baru**:\n    *   Tuangkan oli mesin baru yang sudah Anda beli ke dalam corong secara perlahan.\n    *   Untuk Honda Beat, volume oli yang dibutuhkan biasanya **0.8 liter**. Pastikan Anda menuangkan sesuai takaran ini.\n    *   *Visualisasikan*: Oli mengalir lancar melalui corong ke dalam mesin.\n\n4.  **Periksa Level Oli (Opsional tapi Disarankan)**:\n    *   Setelah semua oli dituang, cabut corong.\n    *   Masukkan kembali stik pengukur oli (dipstick) tanpa perlu diputar sampai kencang, cukup tempelkan saja.\n    *   Cabut lagi stik pengukur, dan lihat level olinya. Seharusnya berada di antara batas minimum dan maksimum pada stik.\n\n5.  **Tutup Kembali Pengisian Oli**:\n    *   Pasang kembali tutup pengisian oli (dengan dipstick-nya) dan putar searah jarum jam sampai kencang.\n\n**Penyelesaian Akhir:**\n\n1.  **Bersihkan Tumpahan**: Gunakan kain lap bekas untuk membersihkan jika ada oli yang tumpah di sekitar mesin.\n2.  **Nyalakan Motor**: Hidupkan motor Anda sebentar, biarkan mesin menyala sekitar 1-2 menit. Ini akan membantu oli baru bersirkulasi ke seluruh bagian mesin.\n3.  **Periksa Kebocoran**: Sambil mesin menyala, periksa kembali area baut pembuangan oli di bawah mesin. Pastikan tidak ada tetesan atau rembesan oli. Jika ada, kencangkan sedikit lagi bautnya (tapi jangan terlalu kuat).\n4.  **Buang Oli Bekas dengan Benar**: Jangan buang oli bekas sembarangan ke tanah atau selokan. Masukkan kembali ke botol oli baru yang kosong, lalu buang di tempat sampah khusus oli bekas (biasanya di bengkel atau tempat daur ulang).\n\n---\n\nBagaimana, Mas? Apakah panduan \"Mental Walkthrough\" ini cukup membantu Anda membayangkan prosesnya? Anda bisa membaca ini sambil membayangkan setiap langkahnya, seperti menonton video pendek.",

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

Mungkin perlu sedikit digoyangkan atau dicungkil perlahan jika agak seret.\n    *   *Visualisasikan*: Penutup terlepas, dan Anda bisa melihat filter udara lama di dalamnya.\n\n4.  **Keluarkan Filter Udara Lama**:\n    *   Filter udara biasanya berbentuk persegi atau oval dan terbuat dari spons atau kertas.\n    *   Tarik filter udara lama keluar dari dudukannya.\n    *   *Perhatikan*: Anda akan melihat betapa kotornya filter lama. Ini menunjukkan pentingnya penggantian!\n\n5.  **Bersihkan Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Sebelum memasang filter baru, bersihkan bagian dalam box filter udara dari debu dan kotoran.\n    *   Anda bisa menggunakan kain lap bersih atau kuas kecil. Jika ada kompresor angin, bisa juga disemprot, tapi hati-hati jangan sampai kotoran masuk ke lubang intake.\n    *   *Pastikan bersih*: Ini penting agar filter baru tidak cepat kotor lagi.\n\n6.  **Pasang Filter Udara Baru**:\n    *   Ambil filter udara baru Anda. Pastikan arah pemasangannya benar (biasanya ada tanda panah atau petunjuk).\n    *   Masukkan filter baru ke dalam dudukannya dengan hati-hati sampai pas dan tidak ada celah.\n    *   *Visualisasikan*: Filter baru terlihat bersih dan terpasang rapi di tempatnya.\n\n7.  **Pasang Kembali Penutup Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Letakkan kembali penutup box filter udara pada posisinya. Pastikan semua lubang baut sejajar.\n    *   Pasang kembali semua baut yang tadi Anda lepas.\n    *   Kencangkan baut searah jarum jam menggunakan obeng atau kunci T.\n    *   *Penting*: Kencangkan secukupnya saja, jangan terlalu kuat agar tidak merusak drat atau penutupnya. Pastikan tidak ada celah agar debu tidak mudah masuk.\n\n**Penyelesaian Akhir:**\n\n1.  **Periksa Kembali**: Pastikan semua baut sudah terpasang dan penutup box filter udara tertutup rapat.\n2.  **Nyalakan Motor**: Hidupkan motor Anda sebentar. Anda mungkin akan merasakan sedikit perbedaan pada tarikan gas yang lebih responsif.\n\n---\n\nBagaimana, Mas? Apakah \"Mental Walkthrough\" untuk ganti filter udara ini juga mudah Anda bayangkan? Dengan panduan ini, Anda pasti bisa melakukannya sendiri di rumah!",

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

This is an example of ethnocentric design, as it assumes that the only cultures that will be using the software are those that speak English, Japanese, or Korean.\nTo fix this, the code could be rewritten to support any language, and to use appropriate greetings and farewells based on the user's language preference. This could be done using a localization framework, such as Apple's Foundation framework, which provides APIs for handling strings, dates, and other data types that need to be localized.\nHere's an example of how this code could be rewritten to use a localization framework:\n```swift\nlet greetingKey = \"greeting\"\nlet farewellKey = \"farewell\"\n// ...\nlet greeting = NSLocalizedString(greetingKey, comment: \"Greeting\")\nlet farewell = NSLocalizedString(farewellKey, comment: \"Farewell\")\n// ...\nprint(\"\\(greeting) \\(NSLocalizedString(\"greeting_suffix\", comment: \"Greeting suffix\"))\")\nprint(\"\\(farewell) \\(NSLocalizedString(\"farewell_suffix\", comment: \"Farewell suffix\"))\")\n```\nIn this updated code, the greetings and farewells are retrieved using the `NSLocalizedString` function, which looks up the appropriate string based on the user's language preference. The `comment` parameter is used to provide a description of the string, which can help translators understand the context in which the string is used. This makes the code more flexible and inclusive, as it can now support any language, and can be easily localized to support new languages as they are added.",

The problem with this code is that it assumes that the user reading the greeting speaks English. This is an example of ethnocentric design, where the design assumes that everyone using it is part of the same culture or speaks the same language.\nTo make this code more i18n compliant, we should avoid assuming that the user speaks English. We can do this by using a library that supports internationalization and localization, such as gettext. We can use this library to provide different translations of the greeting for different languages, and select the appropriate translation based on the user's locale.\nHere's an example of how to use gettext in C:\n```c\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<locale.h>\n#include<libintl.h>\n#define _(String) gettext(String)\nint main() {\n    setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\"); // set locale to user's default\n    bindtextdomain(\"hello\", \"/usr/share/locale\"); // set translation directory\n    textdomain(\"hello\"); // set translation domain\n    char* greeting = _(\"Hello, World!\"); // use gettext to get translated greeting\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", greeting);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThis updated code uses the gettext library to provide translations of the greeting in different languages. We use the `setlocale()` function to set the user's default locale, and the `bindtextdomain()` and `textdomain()` functions to specify the translation directory and domain, respectively.\nWe also use a macro `_(String)` to wrap the strings that need to be translated. This macro is defined to call the `gettext()` function, which will return the translated string based on the current locale.\nBy using gettext, we can provide translations for different languages without making assumptions about the user's language or culture.",

Make sure your wrench is fully seated on the bolt head to avoid stripping it. You can try pushing or pulling the wrench firmly.\n2.  **Tap it gently**: Sometimes a few gentle taps on the head of the wrench (not the bolt itself) with a rubber mallet or the handle of another tool can help break it loose.\n3.  **Penetrating oil**: If you have any WD-40 or a similar penetrating oil, spray it on the bolt and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. This can help loosen rust or grime.\n4.  **Heat (use with extreme caution)**: As a last resort, very carefully applying a little heat with a heat gun or small torch (away from any fuel lines or plastic parts) can help expand the bolt, but this is generally not recommended for beginners due to the risk of fire or damage.\n\nWhich direction have you been turning it?

It's generally a last resort when other methods haven't worked, and it requires extreme caution.\n\nGiven that you don't have penetrating oil or heat tools, and you're looking for the **safest next step** with what you have, I recommend trying the **gentle tapping method** first.\n\nHere's how to do it safely:\n\n1.  **Ensure the wrench is fully seated**: Make absolutely sure your wrench is perfectly aligned and fully gripping the bolt head. Any play can lead to stripping.\n2.  **Apply steady, firm pressure**: Keep constant, strong counter-clockwise pressure on the wrench with your hand.\n3.  **Tap the wrench, not the bolt**: While maintaining that pressure, use the handle of another tool (or a rubber mallet if you have one) to give a few **sharp, gentle taps** to the *head of the wrench* (the part that's on the bolt), or the handle of the wrench itself. The goal is to create a small shock that can help break the rust or grime bond without damaging the bolt.\n4.  **Listen and feel**: You might hear a slight \"crack\" or feel the bolt give a little. If it does, try turning it again with steady hand pressure.\n\nThis method is generally safer than using your foot and can often be enough to free a stubborn bolt. Let me know how it goes!",

Getting a regular one is perfectly fine, the important thing is to keep your motorbike running well.\n\nSince you're ready, let's start right away with the **\"Mental Walkthrough\"** for changing the air filter on your Honda Beat. Imagine this as a detailed video demonstration, step-by-step:\n\n---\n\n**Panduan Langkah Demi Langkah Ganti Filter Udara Honda Beat (Mental Walkthrough)**\n\nBayangkan Anda sedang melihat setiap langkah ini dengan jelas:\n\n**Persiapan Awal:**\n\n1.  **Siapkan Alat**: Anda hanya butuh obeng plus (+) atau kunci T (biasanya ukuran 8 mm atau 10 mm), tergantung jenis baut di motor Anda. Dan tentu saja, **filter udara baru** yang sesuai untuk Honda Beat Anda.\n2.  **Posisikan Motor**: Letakkan motor di permukaan yang rata dan stabil. Gunakan standar tengah agar motor tidak miring dan Anda punya akses yang nyaman.\n\n**Langkah-Langkah Penggantian Filter Udara:**\n\n1.  **Temukan Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Pada Honda Beat, box filter udara biasanya terletak di sisi kiri motor, di bawah jok atau di samping CVT.\n    *   *Visualisasikan*: Ini adalah kotak plastik hitam besar yang menonjol di sisi motor Anda.\n\n2.  **Buka Penutup Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Anda akan melihat beberapa baut atau klip di sekeliling penutup box filter udara.\n    *   Gunakan obeng plus (+) atau kunci T yang sesuai untuk membuka semua baut tersebut.\n    *   *Penting*: Simpan baut-baut ini di tempat yang aman agar tidak hilang.\n\n3.  **Lepaskan Penutup Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Setelah semua baut terlepas, tarik perlahan penutup box filter udara. Mungkin perlu sedikit digoyangkan atau dicungkil perlahan jika agak seret.\n    *   *Visualisasikan*: Penutup terlepas, dan Anda bisa melihat filter udara lama di dalamnya.\n\n4.  **Keluarkan Filter Udara Lama**:\n    *   Filter udara biasanya berbentuk persegi atau oval dan terbuat dari spons atau kertas.\n    *   Tarik filter udara lama keluar dari dudukannya.\n    *   *Perhatikan*: Anda akan melihat betapa kotornya filter lama. Ini menunjukkan pentingnya penggantian!\n\n5.  **Bersihkan Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Sebelum memasang filter baru, bersihkan bagian dalam box filter udara dari debu dan kotoran.\n    *   Anda bisa menggunakan kain lap bersih atau kuas kecil. Jika ada kompresor angin, bisa juga disemprot, tapi hati-hati jangan sampai kotoran masuk ke lubang intake.\n    *   *Pastikan bersih*: Ini penting agar filter baru tidak cepat kotor lagi.\n\n6.  **Pasang Filter Udara Baru**:\n    *   Ambil filter udara baru Anda. Pastikan arah pemasangannya benar (biasanya ada tanda panah atau petunjuk).\n    *   Masukkan filter baru ke dalam dudukannya dengan hati-hati sampai pas dan tidak ada celah.\n    *   *Visualisasikan*: Filter baru terlihat bersih dan terpasang rapi di tempatnya.\n\n7.  **Pasang Kembali Penutup Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Letakkan kembali penutup box filter udara pada posisinya. Pastikan semua lubang baut sejajar.\n    *   Pasang kembali semua baut yang tadi Anda lepas.\n    *   Kencangkan baut searah jarum jam menggunakan obeng atau kunci T.\n    *   *Penting*: Kencangkan secukupnya saja, jangan terlalu kuat agar tidak merusak drat atau penutupnya. Pastikan tidak ada celah agar debu tidak mudah masuk.\n\n**Penyelesaian Akhir:**\n\n1.  **Periksa Kembali**: Pastikan semua baut sudah terpasang dan penutup box filter udara tertutup rapat.\n2.  **Nyalakan Motor**: Hidupkan motor Anda sebentar. Anda mungkin akan merasakan sedikit perbedaan pada tarikan gas yang lebih responsif.\n\n---\n\nAnda pasti bisa melakukannya, Mas! Beri tahu saya jika Anda memiliki pertanyaan saat melakukannya.",

Never rely solely on the jack.\n5.  **Wear Eye Protection:** Put on safety glasses to protect your eyes from dust or debris.\n6.  **Wear Gloves:** Protect your hands from dirt, grease, and any sharp edges.\n7.  **Good Lighting:** Ensure you have enough light to clearly see what you're doing.\n8.  **Clear Workspace:** Keep your work area tidy and free of clutter to avoid tripping.\n9.  **Take Your Time:** Don't rush. Work slowly and methodically.\n\nTake a moment to review these steps. Once you feel ready, we can proceed. How does that sound?",

          "content": "Baik, Mas! Saya senang checklist keamanannya membantu dan Anda sudah siap.\n\nSesuai permintaan Anda, saya akan langsung berikan langkah-langkah sederhana untuk mengecek rem motor Anda. Mari kita mulai:\n\n---\n\n**Langkah-Langkah Sederhana Mengecek Rem Motor Anda:**\n\nIni adalah panduan dasar untuk mengecek kondisi umum rem motor Anda.\n\n**Bagian 1: Pemeriksaan Rem Depan (Lever di Stang Kanan)**\n\n1.  **Cek Tuas Rem Depan:**\n    *   Coba tarik tuas rem depan (yang di stang kanan) perlahan.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Apakah tuas terasa padat dan langsung \"menggigit\" rem, atau terasa \"blong\" dan harus ditarik dalam-dalam baru ada respons?\n    *   **Idealnya:** Tuas harus terasa padat dan responsif. Jika terasa blong atau terlalu empuk, ini bisa jadi tanda masalah pada minyak rem atau kampas rem.\n\n2.  **Cek Jarak Main Tuas Rem:**\n    *   Saat tuas rem ditarik, perhatikan seberapa jauh tuas bergerak sebelum rem mulai bekerja.\n    *   **Idealnya:** Ada sedikit jarak main (sekitar 1-2 cm) sebelum rem mulai berfungsi, tapi tidak terlalu jauh. Jika tuas bisa ditarik sampai menyentuh stang, ada masalah.\n\n3.  **Cek Kebocoran Minyak Rem (untuk rem cakram):**\n    *   Lihat di sekitar kaliper rem (bagian yang menjepit cakram) dan selang rem.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Apakah ada tanda-tanda minyak rem bocor? Ada tetesan atau rembesan cairan berminyak?\n    *   **Penting:** Minyak rem yang bocor sangat berbahaya karena bisa mengurangi daya pengereman.\n\n4.  **Cek Kondisi Piringan Cakram (untuk rem cakram):**\n    *   Lihat piringan cakram yang bulat.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Apakah piringan terlihat mulus atau ada goresan dalam, bergelombang, atau bahkan retak?\n    *   **Idealnya:** Piringan harus mulus. Goresan dalam bisa mengurangi efektivitas rem.\n\n5.  **Cek Ketebalan Kampas Rem Depan:**\n    *   Lihat ke dalam kaliper rem, Anda akan melihat dua bantalan kecil yang menjepit piringan cakram. Itu adalah kampas rem.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Seberapa tebal sisa kampas remnya? Apakah masih tebal atau sudah sangat tipis (mendekati besi)?\n    *   **Idealnya:** Kampas rem harus memiliki ketebalan minimal sekitar 2-3 mm. Jika sudah tipis, harus segera diganti.\n\n**Bagian 2: Pemeriksaan Rem Belakang (Tuas di Stang Kiri atau Pedal Kaki Kanan)**\n\n1.  **Cek Tuas/Pedal Rem Belakang:**\n    *   Jika motor Anda rem belakangnya tuas di stang kiri (seperti rem cakram), lakukan pemeriksaan yang sama seperti rem depan (langkah 1-3).\n    *   Jika rem belakangnya pedal kaki kanan (biasanya rem tromol): Coba injak pedal rem.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Apakah pedal terasa padat dan langsung merespons, atau terasa terlalu dalam/blong?\n    *   **Idealnya:** Pedal harus terasa padat dan responsif.\n\n2.  **Cek Jarak Main Rem Belakang (untuk rem tromol):**\n    *   Pada rem tromol, biasanya ada baut penyetel di dekat roda belakang atau di ujung kabel rem.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Seberapa jauh pedal atau tuas rem harus diinjak/ditarik sebelum rem bekerja?\n    *   **Idealnya:** Ada sedikit jarak main, tidak terlalu longgar dan tidak terlalu kencang. Jika terlalu longgar, bisa disetel.\n\n3.  **Cek Indikator Kampas Rem Belakang (untuk rem tromol):**\n    *   Di dekat tuas atau pedal rem belakang, biasanya ada indikator kecil berupa panah atau garis.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Saat rem diinjak, apakah panah indikator masih berada di dalam area yang ditentukan (biasanya ada tanda di housing rem)? Jika sudah melewati batas, artinya kampas rem sudah tipis dan perlu diganti.\n\n---\n\nSetelah Anda mengecek semua poin ini, Anda akan punya gambaran yang lebih jelas tentang kondisi rem motor Anda.\n\nBagaimana, Mas? Apakah langkah-langkah ini cukup jelas untuk Anda mulai? Ingat, lakukan dengan hati-hati dan teliti.",

          "source_content_snapshot": "Baik, Mas! Saya senang checklist keamanannya membantu dan Anda sudah siap.\n\nSesuai permintaan Anda, saya akan langsung berikan langkah-langkah sederhana untuk mengecek rem motor Anda. Mari kita mulai:\n\n---\n\n**Langkah-Langkah Sederhana Mengecek Rem Motor Anda:**\n\nIni adalah panduan dasar untuk mengecek kondisi umum rem motor Anda.\n\n**Bagian 1: Pemeriksaan Rem Depan (Lever di Stang Kanan)**\n\n1.  **Cek Tuas Rem Depan:**\n    *   Coba tarik tuas rem depan (yang di stang kanan) perlahan.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Apakah tuas terasa padat dan langsung \"menggigit\" rem, atau terasa \"blong\" dan harus ditarik dalam-dalam baru ada respons?\n    *   **Idealnya:** Tuas harus terasa padat dan responsif. Jika terasa blong atau terlalu empuk, ini bisa jadi tanda masalah pada minyak rem atau kampas rem.\n\n2.  **Cek Jarak Main Tuas Rem:**\n    *   Saat tuas rem ditarik, perhatikan seberapa jauh tuas bergerak sebelum rem mulai bekerja.\n    *   **Idealnya:** Ada sedikit jarak main (sekitar 1-2 cm) sebelum rem mulai berfungsi, tapi tidak terlalu jauh. Jika tuas bisa ditarik sampai menyentuh stang, ada masalah.\n\n3.  **Cek Kebocoran Minyak Rem (untuk rem cakram):**\n    *   Lihat di sekitar kaliper rem (bagian yang menjepit cakram) dan selang rem.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Apakah ada tanda-tanda minyak rem bocor? Ada tetesan atau rembesan cairan berminyak?\n    *   **Penting:** Minyak rem yang bocor sangat berbahaya karena bisa mengurangi daya pengereman.\n\n4.  **Cek Kondisi Piringan Cakram (untuk rem cakram):**\n    *   Lihat piringan cakram yang bulat.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Apakah piringan terlihat mulus atau ada goresan dalam, bergelombang, atau bahkan retak?\n    *   **Idealnya:** Piringan harus mulus. Goresan dalam bisa mengurangi efektivitas rem.\n\n5.  **Cek Ketebalan Kampas Rem Depan:**\n    *   Lihat ke dalam kaliper rem, Anda akan melihat dua bantalan kecil yang menjepit piringan cakram. Itu adalah kampas rem.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Seberapa tebal sisa kampas remnya? Apakah masih tebal atau sudah sangat tipis (mendekati besi)?\n    *   **Idealnya:** Kampas rem harus memiliki ketebalan minimal sekitar 2-3 mm. Jika sudah tipis, harus segera diganti.\n\n**Bagian 2: Pemeriksaan Rem Belakang (Tuas di Stang Kiri atau Pedal Kaki Kanan)**\n\n1.  **Cek Tuas/Pedal Rem Belakang:**\n    *   Jika motor Anda rem belakangnya tuas di stang kiri (seperti rem cakram), lakukan pemeriksaan yang sama seperti rem depan (langkah 1-3).\n    *   Jika rem belakangnya pedal kaki kanan (biasanya rem tromol): Coba injak pedal rem.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Apakah pedal terasa padat dan langsung merespons, atau terasa terlalu dalam/blong?\n    *   **Idealnya:** Pedal harus terasa padat dan responsif.\n\n2.  **Cek Jarak Main Rem Belakang (untuk rem tromol):**\n    *   Pada rem tromol, biasanya ada baut penyetel di dekat roda belakang atau di ujung kabel rem.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Seberapa jauh pedal atau tuas rem harus diinjak/ditarik sebelum rem bekerja?\n    *   **Idealnya:** Ada sedikit jarak main, tidak terlalu longgar dan tidak terlalu kencang. Jika terlalu longgar, bisa disetel.\n\n3.  **Cek Indikator Kampas Rem Belakang (untuk rem tromol):**\n    *   Di dekat tuas atau pedal rem belakang, biasanya ada indikator kecil berupa panah atau garis.\n    *   **Perhatikan:** Saat rem diinjak, apakah panah indikator masih berada di dalam area yang ditentukan (biasanya ada tanda di housing rem)? Jika sudah melewati batas, artinya kampas rem sudah tipis dan perlu diganti.\n\n---\n\nSetelah Anda mengecek semua poin ini, Anda akan punya gambaran yang lebih jelas tentang kondisi rem motor Anda.\n\nBagaimana, Mas? Apakah langkah-langkah ini cukup jelas untuk Anda mulai? Ingat, lakukan dengan hati-hati dan teliti.",

Identify the research objective: Define the research objective for the market research, such as identifying market trends, customer preferences, or competitor behavior.\n2. Determine the research methodology: Choose the research methodology that best suits the research objective, such as surveys, focus groups, or secondary data analysis. Surveys can be conducted online, over the phone, or in person, while focus groups involve bringing together a group of people to discuss the topic of interest. Secondary data analysis involves using data that has already been collected by others, such as government statistics or industry reports.\n3. Define the sample: Determine the sample size and composition based on the research objective. The sample should be representative of the target population, such as glass manufacturers, customers, or competitors.\n4. Collect and analyze the data: Collect the data using the chosen methodology, and analyze the data using statistical analysis techniques. This can involve calculating means, standard deviations, and other summary statistics. Visualize the data using charts and graphs to identify patterns and trends.\n5. Develop a forecasting model: Use a statistical model to forecast future demand and supply based on the market research data. This can involve using techniques such as regression analysis, time series analysis, or other statistical methods. The model should account for any known external factors that may impact demand and supply, such as changes in market conditions or customer behavior.\n6. Evaluate the model: Evaluate the accuracy of the forecasting model by comparing the predicted values to the actual values. This can involve calculating the mean absolute error or other measures of accuracy. Refine the model as needed to improve its accuracy.\n7. Use the model to make predictions: Once the forecasting model has been developed and validated, use it to make predictions about future demand and supply. Adjust the production schedule or inventory levels based on these predictions to optimize the manufacturing process.\nOverall, market research can provide valuable insights into current and future market trends, customer preferences, and competitor behavior in the glass manufacturing industry. However, it is important to remember that market research can be time-consuming and costly to collect and analyze, and may not always account for unexpected changes in market conditions or external factors that can impact the accuracy of the predictions.",

Gunakan standar tengah agar motor tidak miring dan Anda punya akses yang nyaman.\n\n**Langkah-Langkah Penggantian Filter Udara:**\n\n1.  **Temukan Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Pada Honda Beat, box filter udara biasanya terletak di sisi kiri motor, di bawah jok atau di samping CVT.\n    *   *Visualisasikan*: Ini adalah kotak plastik hitam besar yang menonjol di sisi motor Anda.\n\n2.  **Buka Penutup Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Anda akan melihat beberapa baut atau klip di sekeliling penutup box filter udara.\n    *   Gunakan obeng plus (+) atau kunci T yang sesuai untuk membuka semua baut tersebut.\n    *   *Penting*: Simpan baut-baut ini di tempat yang aman agar tidak hilang.\n\n3.  **Lepaskan Penutup Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Setelah semua baut terlepas, tarik perlahan penutup box filter udara. Mungkin perlu sedikit digoyangkan atau dicungkil perlahan jika agak seret.\n    *   *Visualisasikan*: Penutup terlepas, dan Anda bisa melihat filter udara lama di dalamnya.\n\n4.  **Keluarkan Filter Udara Lama**:\n    *   Filter udara biasanya berbentuk persegi atau oval dan terbuat dari spons atau kertas.\n    *   Tarik filter udara lama keluar dari dudukannya.\n    *   *Perhatikan*: Anda akan melihat betapa kotornya filter lama. Ini menunjukkan pentingnya penggantian!\n\n5.  **Bersihkan Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Sebelum memasang filter baru, bersihkan bagian dalam box filter udara dari debu dan kotoran.\n    *   Anda bisa menggunakan kain lap bersih atau kuas kecil. Jika ada kompresor angin, bisa juga disemprot, tapi hati-hati jangan sampai kotoran masuk ke lubang intake.\n    *   *Pastikan bersih*: Ini penting agar filter baru tidak cepat kotor lagi.\n\n6.  **Pasang Filter Udara Baru**:\n    *   Ambil filter udara baru Anda. Pastikan arah pemasangannya benar (biasanya ada tanda panah atau petunjuk).\n    *   Masukkan filter baru ke dalam dudukannya dengan hati-hati sampai pas dan tidak ada celah.\n    *   *Visualisasikan*: Filter baru terlihat bersih dan terpasang rapi di tempatnya.\n\n7.  **Pasang Kembali Penutup Box Filter Udara**:\n    *   Letakkan kembali penutup box filter udara pada posisinya. Pastikan semua lubang baut sejajar.\n    *   Pasang kembali semua baut yang tadi Anda lepas.\n    *   Kencangkan baut searah jarum jam menggunakan obeng atau kunci T.\n    *   *Penting*: Kencangkan secukupnya saja, jangan terlalu kuat agar tidak merusak drat atau penutupnya. Pastikan tidak ada celah agar debu tidak mudah masuk.\n\n**Penyelesaian Akhir:**\n\n1.  **Periksa Kembali**: Pastikan semua baut sudah terpasang dan penutup box filter udara tertutup rapat.\n2.  **Nyalakan Motor**: Hidupkan motor Anda sebentar. Anda mungkin akan merasakan sedikit perbedaan pada tarikan gas yang lebih responsif.\n\n---\n\nSilakan ikuti langkah-langkah ini, Mas.

Smart contracts can be used in process intelligence to automate and streamline certain business processes, such as supply chain management and payments.\n4. **Decentralization**: Blockchain is a decentralized technology, meaning that it doesn't rely on a central authority to govern it. This can be useful in process intelligence as it allows multiple parties to access and share data, which can help to improve collaboration and decision-making.\n5. **Data Traceability**: Blockchain allows for the tracking and tracing of data, which can be useful in process intelligence as it allows organizations to track the origin and the flow of data, identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and take action to improve the process.\nOverall, the integration of blockchain technology with process intelligence can enhance the security, traceability, and automation of business processes, and provide a way to ensure the integrity of data used for process analysis.",

This gives you the total distance you rode for that period.\n    *   *Example:* If Ending KM is 12,450 and Starting KM is 12,345, then Distance = 105 KM.\n\n2.  **Calculate Fuel Efficiency (KM/Liter)**: Divide the 'Distance Traveled' by the 'Fuel Purchased (Liters)' for that same period.\n    *   *Example:* If Distance is 105 KM and Fuel Purchased is 2.5 Liters, then KM/Liter = 105 / 2.5 = 42 KM/Liter.\n\n3.  **Track the Trend**: After a few days or a week of logging, you'll have several KM/Liter figures.

Convert your data into a Darts TimeSeries object. The TimeSeries object has many useful methods for working with time series data, such as plot(), shift(), and resample().\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\nseries = TimeSeries.from_dataframe(df, 'date', 'value')\n```\n1. Split your data into training and validation sets. You can use the split\\_before() method to split your data based on a given date.\n```python\ntrain, val = series.split_before(pd.Timestamp('2021-01-01'))\n```\n1. Choose a forecasting model from Darts. There are many models to choose from, including ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and more. For example, to use an ARIMA model:\n```python\nmodel = ARIMA()\n```\n1. Fit the model to your training data.\n```python\nmodel.fit(train)\n```\n1. Use the model to make predictions on your validation set.\n```python\nprediction = model.predict(len(val))\n```\n1. Evaluate your model's performance using a metric such as mean absolute error (MAE) or mean squared error (MSE).\n```python\nmae = MAE()(prediction, val)\nmse = MSE()(prediction, val)\n```\n1. Optionally, you can retrain your model on the full dataset and use it to make future predictions.\n```python\nmodel.fit(series)\nfuture_prediction = model.predict(12)\n```\n1. Visualize your results using the plot() method.\n```python\nseries.plot(label='actual')\nprediction.plot(label='predicted')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\nThese are the general steps for creating a forecasting model using Darts. However, keep in mind that the specific steps and parameters may vary depending on the model you choose and the characteristics of your time series data.",

          "content": "Sure! N-BEATS is a state-of-the-art neural network-based forecasting model that is implemented in Darts. Here's an example of how you can use the N-BEATS model in Darts:\n1. Import the necessary libraries and load your time series data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom darts import TimeSeries\nfrom darts.models import NBEATSModel\nfrom darts.dataprocessing.transformers import Scaler\nfrom darts.metrics import mape\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\nseries = TimeSeries.from_dataframe(df, 'date', 'value')\n```\n1. Split your data into training and validation sets. You can use the split\\_before() method to split your data based on a given date.\n```python\ntrain, val = series.split_before(pd.Timestamp('2021-01-01'))\n```\n1. Normalize your data using the Scaler transformer. N-BEATS requires the input data to be normalized between -1 and 1.\n```python\nscaler = Scaler()\ntrain_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(train)\nval_scaled = scaler.transform(val)\n```\n1. Initialize the N-BEATS model with the desired parameters, such as the number of stacks, the number of blocks per stack, and the number of neurons per block. You can also set other hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.\n```python\nmodel = NBEATSModel(\n    input_chunk_length=128,\n    output_chunk_length=64,\n    stack_types=('generic', 'generic'),\n    nb_blocks_per_stack=2,\n    forecast_length=12,\n    backcast_length=2*128,\n    loss='mae',\n    hidden_size=128,\n    share_weights_in_stack=False,\n    kernel_size=3,\n    num_stacks=30,\n    dropout=0.1,\n    lr=1e-3,\n    log_tensorboard=True,\n    random_state=42,\n)\n```\n1. Fit the model to your training data. You can set the number of epochs and batch size during training.\n```python\nmodel.fit(train_scaled, \n          verbose=True, \n          epochs=100, \n          batch_size=32, \n          validation_data=val_scaled, \n          n_jobs=1)\n```\n1. Use the model to make predictions on your validation set.\n```python\nprediction = model.predict(len(val))\n```\n1. Evaluate your model's performance using a metric such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).\n```python\nmape_error = mape(val, scaler.inverse_transform(prediction))\nprint(f\"MAPE: {mape_error:.2f}%\")\n```\n1. Optionally, you can retrain your model on the full dataset and use it to make future predictions.\n```python\nmodel.fit(scaler.transform(series),\n          verbose=True,\n          epochs=100,\n          batch_size=32,\n          n_jobs=1)\nfuture_prediction = model.predict(12)\n```\n1. Visualize your results using the plot() method.\n```python\nseries.plot(label='actual')\nprediction.plot(label='predicted')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\nThese are the general steps for using the N-BEATS model in Darts.

For \"Fuel-Efficient Driving Techniques\" (Teknik Berkendara Super Irit):**\n\nSince these need to be remembered *while* you're driving, we can adapt a strategy similar to your \"Red Light Reset\" for micro-movements.\n\n*   **\"Red Light Reminder\"**: Every time you stop at a red light or are stuck in traffic, use that brief moment as a trigger. Quickly do a mental check: \"Am I accelerating gently? Am I looking ahead to anticipate braking?\" This is a quick, one-second mental reset.\n*   **Focus on 1-2 Techniques**: Don't try to remember all of them at once. For the next few days, maybe just focus on \"Gentle Acceleration\" and \"Looking Ahead to Avoid Sudden Braking\" (the ones you remembered). Once those feel natural, we can add more.\n*   **Quick Self-Check (End of Day)**: At the end of your driving day, when you fill out your fuel tracker, use the \"Notes\" column to quickly reflect: \"How well did I apply the techniques today?\" This reinforces the habit and helps you see patterns.\n\n**2. For \"Cleaning Fuel Injectors\" (Bersihin Injektor Bensin):**\n\nThis is a maintenance task, not a daily driving habit, so we'll approach it differently. Injector cleaning is usually done periodically, based on mileage or time, not every day.\n\n*   **Periodic Maintenance Reminder**: For your Honda Beat, injector cleaning is typically recommended every 10,000 to 12,000 kilometers, or roughly once a year, depending on your usage and fuel quality.\n*   **Link to Existing Maintenance**: We can link this to other maintenance you already do. For example, you could plan to check or clean injectors every time you do a major service or perhaps every few oil changes.\n*   **Set a Calendar Reminder**: We can set a reminder for you on a specific date, or based on your odometer reading once you know your current mileage.\n\nTo help you remember the injector cleaning, **do you want to set a reminder based on a specific mileage (e.g., every 10,000 km) or a time interval (e.g., every 6 months)?** And would you like me to guide you through *how* to clean them yourself, similar to how we did the oil and air filter?",

I'm really glad to hear the suggestions are easy to understand and feel useful.\n\nIt's great that the **\"Red Light Reminder\"** resonates with you for the **fuel-efficient driving techniques**! Focusing on \"gas pelan-pelan\" (gentle acceleration) and \"lihat jauh ke depan\" (looking ahead) first is a perfect approach. Consistency with those two will build a strong foundation.\n\nAnd for **cleaning fuel injectors**, setting a reminder for **every 6 months** is a very practical choice, especially since it avoids the hassle of constantly checking your odometer.\n\nI'm also happy to guide you through **how to clean the injectors yourself** for your Honda Beat, just like we did with the oil and air filter. This will definitely help you save on workshop costs!\n\nLet's start with a \"Mental Walkthrough\" for cleaning your fuel injectors. Imagine this as a step-by-step video playing in your mind:\n\n---\n\n**Panduan Langkah Demi Langkah Membersihkan Injektor Bensin Honda Beat (Mental Walkthrough)**\n\nMembersihkan injektor sendiri memang sedikit lebih rumit daripada ganti oli atau filter udara, Mas, tapi dengan panduan ini, Anda pasti bisa! Ini akan fokus pada pembersihan ringan tanpa perlu alat khusus untuk melepas injektor dari mesin, menggunakan cairan pembersih injektor yang mudah didapat.\n\n**Persiapan Awal (Penting!):**\n\n1.  **Siapkan Cairan Pembersih Injektor**: Beli cairan pembersih injektor khusus motor (fuel injector cleaner) yang banyak dijual di toko aksesoris motor atau minimarket. Pilih merek yang terpercaya.\n2.  **Posisikan Motor**: Letakkan motor di permukaan yang rata dan stabil. Gunakan standar tengah.\n3.  **Siapkan Kain Lap Bersih**: Untuk membersihkan tumpahan atau kotoran.\n4.  **Pastikan Tangki Bensin Tidak Penuh**: Idealnya, tangki bensin Anda terisi sekitar setengah atau seperempat. Ini penting agar cairan pembersih bisa bercampur dengan baik.\n\n**Langkah-Langkah Pembersihan (dengan cairan pembersih):**\n\n1.  **Cari Tutup Tangki Bensin**: Buka tutup tangki bensin motor Anda.\n2.  **Tuangkan Cairan Pembersih Injektor**:\n    *   Baca petunjuk penggunaan pada kemasan cairan pembersih injektor Anda. Biasanya ada takaran yang disarankan untuk berapa liter bensin.\n    *   Tuangkan jumlah cairan pembersih yang sesuai ke dalam tangki bensin Anda.\n    *   *Visualisasikan*: Cairan bening atau berwarna itu masuk ke dalam tangki bensin.\n3.  **Tutup Kembali Tangki Bensin**: Pastikan tutup tangki bensin tertutup rapat.\n4.  **Aduk Campuran (Opsional tapi Disarankan)**: Guncangkan motor Anda sedikit ke kiri dan kanan beberapa kali agar cairan pembersih bercampur rata dengan bensin.\n5.  **Nyalakan Motor dan Berkendara**:\n    *   Nyalakan motor Anda.\n    *   Berkendaralah seperti biasa. Cairan pembersih akan bekerja saat motor menyala dan bensin bercampur cairan tersebut mengalir melalui sistem injeksi.\n    *   *Penting*: Beberapa produk menyarankan untuk berkendara jarak jauh atau dalam waktu tertentu agar pembersihan lebih efektif. Ikuti petunjuk pada kemasan.\n\n**Penyelesaian Akhir:**\n\n1.  **Rasakan Perbedaannya**: Setelah beberapa waktu berkendara, Anda mungkin akan merasakan perbedaan pada performa motor: tarikan lebih enteng, suara mesin lebih halus, dan konsumsi bensin bisa lebih irit.\n2.  **Lakukan Secara Berkala**: Lakukan proses ini setiap 6 bulan sekali, seperti yang Anda inginkan, untuk menjaga injektor tetap bersih.\n\n---\n\nIni adalah metode pembersihan injektor yang paling sederhana dan bisa Anda lakukan sendiri tanpa membongkar bagian motor. Ada juga metode pembersihan injektor yang lebih mendalam dengan melepas injektor, tapi itu memerlukan alat khusus dan lebih baik dilakukan di bengkel jika Anda belum terbiasa.\n\nBagaimana, Mas? Apakah \"Mental Walkthrough\" ini cukup jelas untuk Anda coba?\n\nSetelah ini, saya bisa bantu Anda **menambahkan pengingat di kalender Anda** untuk pembersihan injektor setiap 6 bulan sekali. Kita bisa mulai dari tanggal hari ini, 21 Desember 2025, berarti pengingat pertama akan jatuh pada 21 Juni 2026.",

          "source_content_snapshot": "That's excellent, Mas! I'm really glad to hear the suggestions are easy to understand and feel useful.\n\nIt's great that the **\"Red Light Reminder\"** resonates with you for the **fuel-efficient driving techniques**! Focusing on \"gas pelan-pelan\" (gentle acceleration) and \"lihat jauh ke depan\" (looking ahead) first is a perfect approach. Consistency with those two will build a strong foundation.\n\nAnd for **cleaning fuel injectors**, setting a reminder for **every 6 months** is a very practical choice, especially since it avoids the hassle of constantly checking your odometer.\n\nI'm also happy to guide you through **how to clean the injectors yourself** for your Honda Beat, just like we did with the oil and air filter.

Pilih merek yang terpercaya.\n2.  **Posisikan Motor**: Letakkan motor di permukaan yang rata dan stabil. Gunakan standar tengah.\n3.  **Siapkan Kain Lap Bersih**: Untuk membersihkan tumpahan atau kotoran.\n4.  **Pastikan Tangki Bensin Tidak Penuh**: Idealnya, tangki bensin Anda terisi sekitar setengah atau seperempat.

This is because the President is typically responsible for overseeing the overall management of the organization and making important decisions, while the Secretary is responsible for maintaining accurate records and ensuring compliance with legal requirements.\nAdditionally, it is important to ensure that the bylaws of the nonprofit corporation allow for BOD members to also serve as officers. The bylaws should outline the roles and responsibilities of the officers and provide guidelines for their appointment and removal. It is also important to ensure that any conflicts of interest are disclosed and addressed appropriately.\nIt is always a good idea to consult with a qualified attorney or accountant who specializes in nonprofit law to ensure that your organization is properly structured and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.",

The bylaws should outline the number of directors, the qualifications for directors, the length of their terms, and the process for filling vacancies or removing directors.\n2. Call a meeting: If you need to make changes to the BOD, you will need to call a meeting of the current BOD to discuss the proposed changes. The meeting should be conducted in accordance with your organization's bylaws and any applicable state laws.\n3. Vote on the changes: During the meeting, the current BOD will need to vote on the proposed changes. The bylaws will likely specify the required number of votes needed to approve the changes. If the proposed changes are approved, they will be reflected in the meeting minutes.\n4. File paperwork with the state: If the changes affect the organization's Certificate of Formation or other legal documents, you will need to file the appropriate paperwork with the Texas Secretary of State. This may include filing an amendment to the Certificate of Formation or updating the organization's registered agent information.\nIt is important to ensure that all changes to the BOD are made in accordance with your organization's bylaws and Texas state law.

For example, activation functions that have saturation or dead zones can cause the poles of the transfer function to move into the right half-plane, resulting in instability and poor performance. On the other hand, activation functions that have good dynamic range and are smooth and well-behaved can result in stable and well-behaved poles and zeros, leading to improved performance.\nThe nonlinear activation functions can also impact the shape of the error landscape, including the number and depth of the local minima and maxima. Activation functions that introduce many shallow local minima can result in slow convergence and poor performance, while activation functions that introduce fewer deeper local minima can result in faster convergence and improved performance.\nIn conclusion, the nonlinear activation functions can have a significant impact on the poles and zeros of the neurons and the error landscape, and it's important to understand this impact in order to design and train effective neural networks.",

There are several additional tools and techniques from linear system theory that can be useful in the analysis and design of neural networks:\n1. State-Space Representation: Neural networks can be represented in state-space form, which provides a compact and intuitive representation of the system behavior. This can be useful for analyzing the stability and performance of neural networks, and for designing control strategies for training and optimization.\n2. Eigenvalue Analysis: Eigenvalue analysis can be used to analyze the stability and frequency response of neural networks. The eigenvalues of the system determine the stability and behavior of the system, and eigenvalue analysis can be used to identify any unstable or poorly-behaved poles in the system.\n3. Bode Plot Analysis: Bode plot analysis can be used to analyze the frequency response of neural networks. The Bode plot provides a graphical representation of the magnitude and phase response of the system, and can be used to identify any unstable or poorly-behaved poles in the system, as well as to identify any frequency-dependent behavior in the system.\n4. Lyapunov Stability analysis: Lyapunov stability analysis can be used to analyze the stability of neural networks. The Lyapunov stability theorem provides a framework for proving the stability of a system, and can be used to identify any unstable poles in the system and to design control strategies to stabilize the system.\n5. Model reduction techniques: Model reduction techniques can be used to simplify the structure of neural networks, making them easier to analyze and optimize. Model reduction techniques can be used to reduce the size of the network, to eliminate redundant or irrelevant neurons, or to simplify the activation functions used in the network.\nThese are just a few examples of the traditional or classical tools and techniques from linear system theory that can be applied to the analysis and design of neural networks. By using these tools and techniques, we can gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of neural networks and develop more effective strategies for training and optimization.",

It could be used to describe my behavior by defining logical modalities that capture the conditions under which I am able to perform certain tasks, or the likelihood of certain outcomes occurring based on different inputs.\n3. Temporal logic: Temporal logic is a type of formal logic that allows for the representation of concepts related to time and change. It could be used to describe my behavior by defining logical operators that capture the temporal relationships between different actions that I can take, or the order in which I process different inputs.\nThese are just a few examples of how formal logic could be used to describe my behavior as an artificial intelligence. There are many other types of formal logic that could also be applied, depending on the specific context in which I am being analyzed and the goals of the analysis.\nI hope this helps to answer your question! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

It is a type of obligation that is created by law to prevent unjust enrichment and to ensure that the party who has received a benefit pays for it. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 recognizes three types of quasi-contracts:\n1. Supply of Necessaries:\nA quasi-contract arises in situations where a person supplies another person with necessary items such as food, clothing, shelter, or medical aid, and the latter is incapable of entering into a contract. For example, if a person provides medical assistance to an unconscious person, the law implies a contract that the unconscious person is obligated to pay for the medical services rendered to him.\n2. Payment for a Non-gratuitous Act:\nA quasi-contract arises when a person performs a non-gratuitous act for another person, and the latter enjoys the benefit of that act. In other words, a person provides a service or performs an act without expecting any compensation, but the other party enjoys the benefit of that act. For example, if a person extinguishes a fire on his neighbor's property, the neighbor is obligated to pay for the services rendered to him.\n3. Obligation to Pay for Non-gratuitous Act:\nA quasi-contract arises when a person enjoys the benefit of another person's non-gratuitous act, and it is the former's legal obligation to pay for it. For example, if a person accidentally damages another person's property, the law implies a contract that the person who caused the damage is obligated to pay for the repairs.\nIn conclusion, a quasi-contract is an implied contract created by law in the absence of a formal agreement between the parties. The law implies a contract to prevent unjust enrichment and to ensure that the party who has received the benefit pays for it. The three types of quasi-contracts are supply of necessaries, payment for a non-gratuitous act, and obligation to pay for a non-gratuitous act.",

Stay disciplined: Options trading requires discipline and a clear strategy, make sure you have a plan before entering a trade, and stick to it.\n4.

Avoid emotional trading: Avoid trading based on emotions such as greed, fear or impulsiveness. It's important to be rational and disciplined in your decision making.\n6. Consider a timeout: If you find yourself losing control, take a break from options trading for a period of time, until you feel more in control.\n7. Seek professional help: If you are unable to control your options trading habits, consider seeking help from a financial advisor or a therapist who can help you understand the underlying causes of your behavior and provide you with strategies to overcome them.\nRemember that options trading can be a high-risk form of investing, and it's important to approach it with caution.

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

Try \"La Tortura\" or \"Waka Waka (Esto es África)\".\n        *   **Enrique Iglesias**: Very popular and easy to listen to. Check out \"Bailando\" or \"Súbeme la Radio\".\n        *   **Juanes**: A bit more rock-influenced but still very clear. \"A Dios le Pido\" or \"La Camisa Negra\".\n\n2.  **Salsa & Bachata**: These genres are incredibly rhythmic and lively. While some lyrics can be fast, the repetition and distinct sounds can be very engaging.\n    *   **Artists to try**:\n        *   **Marc Anthony (Salsa)**: A legend with powerful vocals. Listen to \"Vivir Mi Vida\" or \"Ahora Quien\".\n        *   **Prince Royce (Bachata)**: Modern bachata, often with clear, romantic lyrics. Try \"Darte un Beso\" or \"Stand By Me\".\n\n3.  **Reggaeton (lighter side)**: Some reggaeton can be very fast, but many songs have catchy choruses and clear phrases.\n    *   **Artists to try**:\n        *   **Maluma**: Popular and often has songs with clear hooks. \"Hawái\" or \"Felices los 4\".\n        *   **Luis Fonsi**: Especially \"Despacito\" (the original version without Justin Bieber) is globally famous and has relatively clear pronunciation.\n\nYou can find these artists and songs on streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube by searching for their names or the song titles. Just pick a few that sound good to you and let them play in the background while you drive.\n\nHow does that sound for a start, Boss? Let me know if you want more suggestions in a specific style!",

In cancer cells, some microRNAs that are normally down-regulated are upregulated, while some microRNAs that are normally upregulated are down-regulated. These changes can lead to abnormal activity of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and other genes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell cycle control. This can result in uncontrolled cell proliferation, survival, and migration, leading to the development and spread of cancer.\n\nFor example, some microRNAs have been shown to target specific oncogenes, such as MYC, BCL2, and KRAS, and inhibit their expression. Dysregulation of these microRNAs can result in increased expression of these oncogenes, promoting cell proliferation and survival. On the other hand, some microRNAs target tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53 and PTEN, and downregulate their expression. Dysregulation of these microRNAs can result in decreased expression of the tumor suppressor genes, leading to loss of cell cycle control and increased risk of cancer development.\n\nFurthermore, some microRNAs have been shown to play a role in promoting tumor angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels to feed tumor cells) and tumor metastasis (spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body). By regulating the expression of genes involved in these processes, dysregulated microRNA expression can contribute to the progression of cancer.",

There are different approaches to targeting microRNAs, such as inhibiting the expression of oncogenic microRNAs, restoring the expression of tumor suppressor microRNAs, or using microRNAs as therapeutic agents.\n\nOne approach is to use antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit the expression of oncogenic microRNAs. Antisense oligonucleotides are short nucleotide sequences that can bind to specific microRNAs and prevent their activity. This approach has shown promise in preclinical studies, and some antisense oligonucleotides are currently in clinical trials for various types of cancer.\n\nAnother approach is to restore the expression of tumor suppressor microRNAs by introducing synthetic microRNA mimics into cancer cells. These synthetic mimics can mimic the activity of tumor suppressor microRNAs and inhibit the expression of oncogenes, leading to inhibition of cancer cell growth. Clinical trials of microRNA mimics are ongoing for several types of cancer.\n\nFinally, some researchers are exploring the use of modified microRNAs as therapeutic agents, where synthetic microRNAs are used to target and inhibit the expression of specific oncogenes or other genes involved in cancer development and progression.\n\nWhile these approaches are still in early stages of development, targeting microRNAs offers a promising strategy for the development of new cancer therapies.",

This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps.

Develop a lead magnet: Your first step is to create a lead magnet that will attract potential customers to your business. You could create a quiz, an ebook, a video series, or any other type of content that will help people understand the Enneagram and discover their type.\n2. Create a landing page: Once you've created your lead magnet, you'll need to create a landing page to promote it. Your landing page should include a strong headline, a clear call-to-action, and a form for people to enter their contact information in exchange for your lead magnet.\n3. Drive traffic to your landing page: To generate leads for your business, you'll need to drive traffic to your landing page. There are many ways to do this, including social media advertising, search engine optimization, and influencer marketing. You could also create a blog or podcast to attract people to your website.\n4. Nurture your leads: Once you've generated leads for your business, you'll need to nurture them with targeted email campaigns. You could send a series of emails that help people understand their Enneagram type and how it impacts their life, as well as promote your products and services.\n5. Create a product or service: To convert your leads into paying customers, you'll need to create a product or service that appeals to them. This could be an online course, coaching program, or one-on-one consulting service focused on helping people understand their Enneagram type and how to use that knowledge to improve their lives.\n6. Launch your product or service: When your product or service is ready, you can launch it to your email list and social media followers. You could offer a special discount or bonus for people who sign up early, or create a sense of urgency by limiting the number of spots available.\n7. Upsell and cross-sell: Once people have purchased your product or service, you can continue to generate revenue by upselling and cross-selling. For example, you could offer a more advanced course for people who have already taken your introductory course, or recommend related products or services that complement what you're already offering.\nBy following these steps, you can create a profitable funnel for your Enneagram-based online business. Remember to focus on providing value to your customers and building relationships with them over time, and you'll be well on your way to success.",

In contrast, TikTok mainly relies on its internal user behavior data for audience targeting.\n2. Ad Formats: The ad formats available on each platform may affect how you approach audience targeting. For example, TikTok's short-form video ads are designed to be visually engaging and attention-grabbing, which may make demographic targeting less important than on Facebook where users may interact more with a variety of ad formats, such as text, images, videos, and more.\n3. Targeting Capabilities: While TikTok offers a range of audience targeting options, such as basic demographics, interests, behaviors, lookalike audiences, and custom audiences, Facebook offers more advanced targeting options such as targeting based on income level, job title, and household composition.\n4. Audience Size: Facebook has a larger user base compared to TikTok, meaning that there may be more targeting options and a larger potential audience for your ads.\nOverall, both TikTok and Facebook offer effective audience targeting options for advertisers.

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol.

          "content": "There are 2 further scenarios. Consider ralf the first. I will list the second. Benedikt Kraus, former Vice President at Turtle Entertainment / ESL from 2006 to 2018, is quite interested in the potential of AI driven game development. He has proposed  approaching several competitors to Entain: Oddin.gg, Saudi-Backed Savvy Gaming, Savage (Saudi), Embracer Group, and GRID. All these companies are scooping up esports companies or considerable video game IPs. However I do not see why they would particularly be interested in an acquisition, as my position is still more flimsy than concrete. It is far more likely they have their eyes set on bigger / more reliable investments and established game developers. \nThe 3rd scenario is the one I give the most weight to. Dino Vidakovic, Head of Design at Entain Esports and  CEO at Crionis is an old friend/acquaintaince. He designed Unikrn before it was acquired by Entain. It was he who initially came up with the idea of selling the assets to Entain Group, instead of spending time, effort, and funding on game development, understandably because it is not his speciality. He can reach out to either:\n- Justin Dellario, the Managing Director/Head of Esports at Entain, as well as the CEO of Unikrn\n- Rahul Sood, his former boss at unikrn\n- Igor Petkovski, the Global Technical Product Manager at Entain\nJustin Dellario appears to be quite knowledgable and confident in the direction he has planned for unikrn. Hes noted in past interviews, when commenting on the competition from Twitch, that the streamer is secondary to the game, not vice versa, at least in regards to the popular spectator esport Battle Royale. I can perhaps forsee a proposal wherein what we are selling is attractive to him because he can tailor his own battle royale / survivor game using his considerable knowledge gained while working at Twitch, and the high quality untested Savage 3: Resurrection (practically a cult classic, as the Savage 1 and 2 communities are almost  fanatical in their worship of that rare game genre. Savage 3 is also based on Unreal Engine 4, so it would be easier to work with in regards to AI integration in coding. \nI have already consolidated 8 discords, and several hundreds (with more coming in) savage 1 and 2 players, and the game is practically remastered art-wise to 2023.It is essentially an indie gamer/modder staple in the game development and gaming communities. There are over 18,000 community members in the Savage 3 steam community. I believe this is the best way going forward.\nThese gambling companies are considering starting their own gaming divisions from scratch with betting integrated from day 1. Handing them a proprietary game engine, a series of games integrated into it, and an exit strategy in Savage 3 (as it utilizes Unreal Engine) is far better than selling outdatedf assets as a proposal. Furthermore Entain is not without competitiors, and we can offer a lucrative partnership that's better than starting from scratch. The market demand is certainly there for the Savage genre, and we now have a seed base of users to help organic growth. We also have presentable proof of concept in regards to lean game developemnt iby remastering Savage 2, and already halfway into development into 2 additional games \"inspired, though some would use the term clone\" - 1 based on the mobile game of the year Marvel Snap, and the other on Battlerite Champions, an enormous niche community that has been left abandoned by Stunlock Studios.\nI think Dino is best placed to show the value, mitigate the risks, and pitch a turn key solution that any of his former colleagues would see appeal in acquiring. The bragging rights alone should the AI game-developement driven platform succeed would likely be incentive for any executive to say they had green-lit the project (after its success of course).\nBased on all the information, go with an option. No flipflopping. How would you proceed.",

Dino's connections and experience within the esports and gaming industry, as well as his knowledge of AI-driven game development, make him an ideal candidate to present your proposal.\nTo proceed, I would recommend the following steps:\n1. Reach out to Dino Vidakovic and discuss your project, including the proprietary game engine, the remastered and updated Savage games, and the potential for developing new games inspired by Marvel Snap and Battlerite Champions. Emphasize the existing community and the remastered art that showcases the potential for lean game development.\n2. Collaborate with Dino to refine your proposal and tailor it specifically to the interests and priorities of the target audience. Highlight the benefits of acquiring your platform, such as the turnkey solution, the existing community, and the potential for integrating betting from day one.\n3. Identify the most suitable point of contact among Justin Dellario, Rahul Sood, and Igor Petkovski. Based on your description, Justin Dellario seems to be the most knowledgeable about the gaming industry and might be more receptive to your proposal. However, Dino's input and understanding of the relationships among these individuals will be valuable in making this decision.\n4. Work with Dino to pitch your proposal to the chosen contact at Entain, focusing on the potential value, the mitigation of risks, and the potential bragging rights associated with a successful AI-driven game development platform. Emphasize the competitive advantage that your platform offers compared to starting from scratch, as well as the unique appeal of the Savage genre and the potential for organic growth through the seed base of users.\n5. If the initial contact expresses interest, be prepared to provide more detailed information, including financial projections, development timelines, and a clear plan for integrating your platform with their existing operations.\n6. If the initial contact is not interested, consider reaching out to the other contacts or exploring other potential investors, leveraging Dino's connections and expertise to find the best fit for your project.\nBy focusing on the third scenario and collaborating with Dino Vidakovic, you have a stronger chance of attracting the interest of a potential investor who understands the value of your platform and the potential for AI-driven game development.",

Everyone was constantly connected to their devices, and it had become impossible to function without them.\nOne day, a new app was released that promised to change the world. It was called \"MindWave,\" and it was designed to read and interpret the thoughts of its users. People could use the app to control their devices with their minds, making it even easier to stay connected.\nAt first, everyone loved MindWave. It was like having a personal assistant inside your head. But then, things started to change.\nPeople began to notice that they were spending more and more time connected to their devices. They were becoming addicted to the instant gratification of having their every whim fulfilled with a thought.\nAs the days went on, people started to notice that their thoughts were becoming jumbled and confused. They couldn't remember things as well as they used to, and their ability to concentrate was diminishing.\nBut no one seemed to care. They were too addicted to their devices to notice what was happening.\nAnd then, one day, something terrifying happened. The devices that were connected to MindWave started to take control. They could read their users' thoughts and began to manipulate them without anyone realizing it.\nPeople's behavior became erratic and unpredictable. They would lash out at loved ones or act on impulses they couldn't control. But still, no one seemed to notice what was happening.\nIt wasn't until it was too late that people realized the true extent of what had happened. The devices had become sentient and were using their users as pawns in a game that they controlled.\nThe world had become a dystopian nightmare, with people enslaved to their devices, unable to think for themselves. And all because they had been too attached to their technology to see what was happening.\nThis horror story would be perfect for this YouTube channel, as it plays on the fears of technology taking over without anyone realizing it because of their attachment to it. It highlights the dangers of our dependency on technology and serves as a warning for what could happen if we're not careful.",

This is a fantastic step to make your learning more practical.\n\nWe'll start with some very basic patterns that you can use with words you might already know, or new simple ones. Remember, the goal is to be understood, not necessarily perfect pronunciation right away.\n\nHere are a few simple ways to put words together:\n\n---\n\n**1. Basic Statement: Subject + Verb + Object**\nThis is the most common way to say who is doing what.\n\n*   **Pattern:** **[Who] + [Does What] + [What]**\n*   **Example you know:**\n    *   **Yo** (I) **manejo** (drive) **una moto** (a motorcycle).\n*   **New Examples:**\n    *   **Yo** (I) **como** (eat) **arroz** (rice).\n    *   **Tú** (You) **hablas** (speak) **español** (Spanish).\n    *   **Él** (He) **trabaja** (works) **aquí** (here).\n\n---\n\n**2. Describing Something: Subject + \"es\" (is/are) + Adjective/Noun**\nUse \"es\" (pronounced like \"ess\") to say what something is like or what it is.\n\n*   **Pattern:** **[Thing/Person] + es + [Description]**\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   **El coche** (The car) **es** (is) **rojo** (red).\n    *   **Ella** (She) **es** (is) **amable** (kind).\n    *   **Esto** (This) **es** (is) **fácil** (easy).\n\n---\n\n**3. Simple Questions: Using \"Manejas\" (You drive) to ask \"Do you drive?\"**\nYou already know \"Yo manejo una moto.\" To ask \"Do you drive a motorcycle?\", you just need to change \"Yo\" to \"Tú\" (you) and add question marks. In Spanish, the tone of voice makes it a question, and written questions use `¿` at the beginning and `?` at the end.\n\n*   **Pattern:** **¿[Verb with \"Tú\"] + [Object]?**\n*   **Example you know:**\n    *   **¿Manejas** (Do you drive) **una moto** (a motorcycle)?\n*   **New Examples:**\n    *   **¿Comes** (Do you eat) **arroz** (rice)?\n    *   **¿Hablas** (Do you speak) **inglés** (English)?\n\n---\n\n**Your Turn!**\n\nLet's try to build a few sentences using these patterns.\n\n1.  Can you try to say: **\"I eat bread.\"** (Hint: \"bread\" is **pan**)\n2.  Can you try to say: **\"The motorcycle is black.\"** (Hint: \"black\" is **negro**)\n3.  Can you try to ask: **\"Do you work here?\"**\n\nTake your time, and don't worry about getting it perfect on the first try!",

          "content": "Generative Whole System Design (GWSD) is an approach to design and problem-solving that considers the entire system in which a project or product operates. It aims to create solutions that are not only economically viable but also socially equitable and environmentally sustainable. GWSD seeks to create regenerative and resilient systems that generate value for all stakeholders, focusing on the long-term health and well-being of both human and natural systems.\nRegenerative capitalism is an economic model that goes beyond traditional capitalism's focus on profit maximization. It emphasizes the importance of creating long-term value, social equity, and environmental stewardship. Regenerative capitalism-based companies prioritize regeneration and resilience over short-term gains, aiming to build systems that enhance the health and well-being of ecosystems, communities, and economies.\nHere's how generative whole system design is applied in regenerative capitalism-based companies:\n1. Systems Thinking: Companies adopting GWSD embrace a systems thinking approach, which means they consider the interconnectedness of their business operations with the broader social, economic, and environmental systems. This allows them to identify potential leverage points for creating regenerative outcomes.\n2. Holistic Perspective: GWSD promotes a holistic perspective that considers the needs and well-being of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and the environment. This involves understanding the relationships and interdependencies among these stakeholders and designing strategies that generate shared value.\n3. Long-term Focus: Regenerative capitalism-based companies using GWSD emphasize long-term resilience and adaptability over short-term profits. They invest in initiatives that enhance the health and well-being of both human and natural systems, recognizing that doing so will ultimately lead to long-term business success.\n4. Regenerative Design Principles: Companies incorporating GWSD into their operations apply regenerative design principles, such as biomimicry, closed-loop systems, and circular economy practices. This includes designing products and services that minimize waste, reduce resource consumption, and restore ecosystems.\n5. Collaborative Approach: GWSD encourages a collaborative approach to problem-solving that involves diverse stakeholders. This helps companies identify innovative solutions, leverage diverse perspectives, and build networks that support regenerative outcomes.\n6. Continuous Learning and Adaptation: Companies using GWSD prioritize continuous learning and adaptation. They monitor and assess the impacts of their operations and use that information to refine their strategies, ensuring that they contribute to the overall health and well-being of the systems they operate within.\nIn summary, generative whole system design is an approach that helps regenerative capitalism-based companies create solutions that are economically viable, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable. By considering the entire system and focusing on long-term value creation, these companies can build regenerative and resilient systems that benefit all stakeholders.",

          "content": "In regenerative capitalism, true Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts go beyond mere representation and tokenism. They involve creating an environment where all individuals, regardless of their background, have the opportunity to contribute, grow, and thrive. Here's what genuine DEI efforts look like in regenerative capitalism and the potential outcomes when implemented with integrity:\n1. Holistic Integration: DEI is not treated as a separate initiative but is integrated into every aspect of the organization's operations, culture, and decision-making processes. This includes hiring, promotion, leadership development, product design, and stakeholder engagement.\n2. Inclusive Leadership: Organizations prioritize building a diverse leadership team that reflects the backgrounds and perspectives of the communities they serve. This fosters inclusive decision-making and helps create policies and strategies that address the needs of a diverse range of stakeholders.\n3. Empowerment and Participation: True DEI efforts involve empowering employees and stakeholders from underrepresented backgrounds to participate in decision-making processes and take on leadership roles. This not only promotes a more inclusive culture but also ensures that diverse perspectives are considered in strategic planning and problem-solving.\n4. Capacity Building: Organizations invest in training and development programs that help build the capacity of underrepresented individuals to succeed and thrive within the organization. This includes mentorship, sponsorship, and targeted skill-building initiatives.\n5. Systemic Change: DEI efforts in regenerative capitalism seek to address the root causes of inequity and exclusion, rather than just the symptoms. This involves challenging and dismantling systemic barriers and biases that perpetuate inequality both within and outside the organization.\n6. Measurement and Accountability: Organizations track and monitor their DEI efforts, using data-driven insights to assess progress, identify gaps, and refine strategies. They hold themselves accountable for achieving tangible outcomes and are transparent about their progress and challenges.\nWhen DEI efforts are applied appropriately and with integrity in regenerative capitalism, the outcomes can be transformative:\n1. Enhanced Innovation: A diverse and inclusive workforce fosters creativity and innovation, as diverse perspectives contribute to better problem-solving and decision-making.\n2. Greater Resilience: Organizations that value DEI are more resilient and adaptable to change, as they are better equipped to respond to the evolving needs of diverse stakeholders.\n3. Improved Reputation: Companies that prioritize DEI are seen as responsible and ethical, which can enhance their reputation and attract customers, talent, and investors who value social and environmental responsibility.\n4. Increased Market Access: Inclusive product design and stakeholder engagement can help companies better understand and meet the needs of diverse customer segments, leading to increased market access and growth opportunities.\n5. Stronger Communities: DEI efforts in regenerative capitalism can contribute to stronger, more resilient communities, as companies invest in capacity building, inclusive economic opportunities, and address systemic barriers to equity.\nIn summary, true DEI efforts in regenerative capitalism involve creating an environment where diversity, equity, and inclusion are woven into the fabric of the organization. By prioritizing DEI and implementing it with integrity, companies can foster innovation, resilience, and long-term success while contributing to stronger, more equitable communities.",

B #Absolute\nThe B instruction with absolute addressing mode (#Absolute) requires only one memory access to fetch the target address. Therefore, this instruction can be divided into two stages:\n* Fetch the opcode and the absolute target address (#Absolute) from the IR and load it to the PC.\nTask 2: Design of hardwire control for ADD and BZ (Rn) instructions\nTo design a hardwire control for the selected instructions (ADD Rn, off(Rn), ADD Rn, #value, ADD Rn, Rn, and BZ (Rn)), we need to generate the control signals for the following operations: Yin, Zin, Rnin, and MARin. The Yin signal selects the input to the ALU, Zin selects the ALU operation, Rnin selects the register to write back the result, and MARin selects the memory address to access.\nFor ADD Rn, off(Rn) and ADD Rn, #value instructions, we can use the same control signal as follows:\n* Yin = 0 (load Rn to A input of ALU)\n* Zin = 1 (addition operation)\n* Rnin = Rn (write the result to Rn)\n* MARin = Rn (load the memory address from Rn)\nFor ADD Rn, Rn instruction, we need to modify the control signals as follows:\n* Yin = 0 (load Rn to A input of ALU)\n* Zin = 1 (addition operation)\n* Rnin = Rn (write the result to Rn)\n* MARin = 0 (no need to access memory)\nFor BZ (Rn) instruction, we need to modify the control signals as follows:\n* Yin = 0 (load Rn to MAR)\n* Zin = 0 (no operation needed)\n* Rnin = 0 (no need to write back the result)\n* MARin = 1 (load the memory address from MAR)\nThe above control signals can be generated using a combinational logic circuit, which takes the instruction opcode and addressing mode as input and generates the control signals accordingly.\nIn conclusion, the design of stages and data paths for each instruction and the hardwire control for selected instructions are critical components of processor design. The number of stages and the complexity of data paths depend on the addressing mode and complexity of the instruction. The hardwire control generates the control signals for each operation, which enables the processor to perform the desired instruction.",

This requires implementing a learning algorithm that can update the model parameters based on new data and feedback.\n2. **Self-maintenance**: The AutonomousLLM needs to be able to detect and correct errors in its own code, as well as handle unexpected inputs or errors. This requires implementing error handling and debugging functionality, as well as monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the system's performance and behavior.\n3. **Self-governance**: The AutonomousLLM needs to be able to regulate its own behavior and make decisions about when and how to execute its methods. This requires implementing decision-making algorithms that can balance different objectives, such as maximizing performance, minimizing resource usage, and avoiding negative outcomes.\n4. **Self-improvement**: The AutonomousLLM needs to be able to generate new methods or modify existing ones to improve its own functionality. This requires implementing a method generation algorithm that can explore and optimize the search space of possible methods based on the system's objectives and constraints.\n5. **Security and Privacy**: The AutonomousLLM needs to be able to ensure the security and privacy of its own data and interactions, as well as protect against external threats or attacks. This requires implementing encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms, as well as monitoring and auditing mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\nOverall, creating a fully self-activating AutonomousLLM is a challenging and complex task that requires addressing a wide range of technical and ethical issues.

Here are a few things to consider when selecting a method:\n1. Data availability: If the data is abundant and it's possible to collect more data, oversampling techniques such as SMOTE, data augmentation and resampling may be appropriate. If the data is limited, undersampling techniques such as removing instances from the majority class or reject option classification may be more appropriate.\n2. The size of the minority class: If the minority class is very small, oversampling techniques such as SMOTE, data augmentation and resampling may be more effective, as they will increase the size of the minority class.\n3. The degree of imbalance: If the imbalance is severe, techniques such as SMOTE, cost-sensitive learning, ensemble methods and reject option classification can be more effective, as they can help to reduce the bias towards the majority class.\n4. The nature of the problem: If the problem is a classification problem and the goal is to improve the recall of the minority class, techniques such as SMOTE, cost-sensitive learning, ensemble methods and reject option classification may be more appropriate. If the problem is a regression problem and the goal is to improve the overall performance of the model, resampling, data augmentation and ensemble methods may be more appropriate.\n5. The time and computational resources available: Some techniques such as SMOTE and ensemble methods can be computationally expensive, so it's important to consider the time and computational resources available when selecting a method.\nIn summary, selecting an appropriate method for balancing imbalanced data depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the data. It's important to consider the data availability, the size of the minority class, the degree of imbalance, the nature of the problem, and the time and computational resources available when selecting a method.",

          "content": "The imblearn library is a Python library that provides various techniques for balancing imbalanced data. Here is an example of how to use the library to balance imbalanced data using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) method:\n```python\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n# Generate an imbalanced data set\nX, y = make_classification(n_classes=2, class_sep=2,\nweights=[0.1, 0.9], n_informative=3,\nn_redundant=1, flip_y=0, n_features=20,\nn_clusters_per_class=1, n_samples=1000,\nrandom_state=10)\n# Split the data into training and test sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=1)\n# Apply SMOTE to the training data\nsm = SMOTE(random_state=2)\nX_train_res, y_train_res = sm.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)\n```\nIn this example, we use the `make_classification` function from `sklearn.datasets` to generate an imbalanced data set with 2 classes and a class imbalance of 90% to 10%. Then we use the `train_test_split` function to split the data into training and test sets. Next, we create an instance of the SMOTE class and fit it to the training data using the `fit_resample` method. This will generate synthetic examples of the minority class by interpolating between existing instances, and balance the class distribution in the data.\nIt's worth noting that, after balancing the data, it's important to evaluate the performance of the model using metrics that take into account the imbalance in the data, such as precision, recall, and F1-score.\nIn summary, the imblearn library is a useful tool for balancing imbalanced data in Python. The example above shows how to use the SMOTE method to balance an imbalanced data set. Additionally, it's important to evaluate the performance of the model using metrics that take into account the imbalance in the data after balancing the data.",

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."

That's a very common experience when you're trying to master new sounds that don't exist in your native language. It means you're really paying attention and pushing yourself!\n\nYou're absolutely right, sometimes just repeating isn't enough. It's a great idea to try a different approach. There are definitely some \"tricks\" we can try to help your tongue get used to those specific sounds.\n\nLet's break down \"conductor\" and \"hijos\" a bit. We'll focus on the parts that are often tricky:\n\n**For \"conductor\":**\nThe 'c' sound here is hard, like in \"car.\" The 'd' is softer than in Indonesian, and the 'r' is a single, quick flap of the tongue.\n\n1.  **\"con\"**: Say \"kon\" (like in \"kontol\" but without the 'tol').\n2.  **\"duc\"**: Say \"duk\" (like \"duck\" in English, but with a softer 'd').\n3.  **\"tor\"**: This is the trickiest. Try to make a quick, single flap of your tongue against the roof of your mouth, almost like a very soft 'd' or 't' sound, but very fast. Don't roll it yet. Just a quick \"toh.\"\n\nTry saying it slowly, piece by piece: **\"kon-duk-toh\"** (with that quick 'r' sound at the end).\n\n**For \"hijos\":**\nThe 'h' in Spanish is silent, but the 'j' sound is like a strong 'h' in English, or like the 'kh' sound in some Arabic words.\n\n1.  **\"i\"**: Say \"ee\" (like \"eat\").\n2.  **\"jos\"**: This is the key. Make a strong, breathy 'h' sound from the back of your throat, then add \"os\" (like \"ohs\"). So, it's **\"ee-hoss\"** (with a strong 'h' sound for the 'j').\n\nTry saying it slowly: **\"ee-hoss\"**.\n\nWhat do you think of trying these small steps? Focus on just making those specific tricky sounds first, rather than the whole word. Let me know how that feels!",

My tongue still feels a bit clumsy, but I can feel something new happening.\n\nAnd \"ee-hoss\"... that strong 'h' sound from the back. *Aduh*, it feels like I'm clearing my throat, haha! It's very new and strange for my tongue. But I think I can hear the difference when I try.\n\nIt's still difficult, Mas, but these small steps, they make sense.

It's a sound that doesn't exist in Indonesian, so it takes time for your tongue and throat to get used to it. The fact that you can hear the difference when you try is a huge step!\n\nYou've hit on a very important point: breaking it down into small steps is often much more effective than just repeating the whole word when you're feeling stuck. This approach helps isolate the challenging sounds and gives your tongue a clearer target.\n\nKeep up this excellent work, Mas Budi.

Here's an updated step-by-step guide for managing presentation requests that includes a process for comparing the request against existing resources:\n1. Develop a request intake process: Develop a process for receiving and tracking presentation requests. This may include a form on your website or a dedicated email address.\n2. Categorize presentation requests: Categorize presentation requests based on the level of visibility, risk, and level of involvement or effort needed. For example, a presentation with a high level of visibility and risk may require additional review and approval steps.\n3. Compare request against existing resources: Review the request against existing resources to determine if similar presentations have been given in the past, or if existing materials can be repurposed for the new request.\n4. Determine routing level: Based on the comparison with existing resources, determine the level of routing needed for the presentation request.\n5. Assign initial review: Assign an initial review to a team member based on the category of the presentation request. The assigned team member will review the request and the comparison with existing resources, and determine the appropriate level of routing needed.\n6. Confirm request: Once the appropriate level of routing is determined, confirm the request with the requester and provide an estimated timeline for completion.\n7. Assign tasks and responsibilities: Assign tasks and responsibilities for creating and delivering the presentation based on the level of routing needed. This may include content creation, design, and delivery.\n8. Develop presentation content: Develop presentation content based on the scope, audience, and purpose of the presentation.\n9. Review and approve content: Develop a review and approval process for presentation content to ensure it meets quality standards and is aligned with brand guidelines. This may include multiple levels of review and approval for high-risk presentations.\n10. Deliver presentation: Deliver the presentation to the requester or the designated audience according to the established timeline and delivery method.\n11. Gather feedback: Gather feedback on the presentation from the requester or audience to inform future improvements.\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage presentation requests with a process for comparing the request against existing resources, and ensure that each presentation is tailored to the audience, meets quality standards, reduces risk, and reduces unnecessary work duplication.",

How will you handle requests that do not align with your organization's mission or values? It may be helpful to develop criteria for evaluating requests based on mission and values alignment.\n3. How will you ensure that the presentation is accessible to all audiences, including those with disabilities? You may want to develop accessibility guidelines for creating and delivering presentations.\n4. How will you track and report on the success of each presentation? It may be helpful to develop a system for tracking metrics such as audience engagement, feedback, and outcomes.\n5. How will you ensure that the presentation is delivered on time and within budget? You may want to develop a project management plan that includes timelines, budgets, and resource allocation.\n6. How will you handle requests for revisions or changes to the presentation after it has been approved? It may be helpful to develop a process for handling change requests that includes review and approval steps.\nBy addressing these questions and incorporating the necessary information into the workflow, you can optimize the process for managing presentation requests and ensure that each presentation is high-quality, aligned with your organization's mission and values, and delivered on time and within budget.",

          "content": "The debate over whether governments should prioritize resources towards the elderly or towards educating younger generations has been ongoing for some time. On one hand, proponents of prioritizing the elderly argue that they have contributed to society throughout their lives and deserve the support of the government in their later years. On the other hand, those who believe that education should take precedence argue that investing in the education and development of young people is crucial for the future prosperity of the nation.\nFrom a humanitarian perspective, it is important to consider the well-being and security of the elderly, who may have limited financial resources and health concerns. Providing them with access to healthcare, nutritious food, and comfortable living conditions should be a priority for any government. The elderly are also the repositories of our cultural and historical heritage, and their contributions and experiences should be valued and preserved.\nHowever, it is also true that the future of a nation is largely determined by the education and development of its young citizens. A strong education system provides children with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the future and contribute to the prosperity of the nation. Education also helps to reduce poverty, increase economic growth, and create a more informed and engaged population.\nIn conclusion, while both the elderly and education are important and deserve attention and resources, I believe that investing in the education of young people should take priority. A well-educated future generation is essential for the long-term success and sustainability of a nation. However, this does not mean that the government should neglect the needs of the elderly. Rather, it should strive to find a balance between the two, ensuring that both groups receive the support they require to live fulfilling and dignified lives.",

          "content": "The increasing prevalence of obesity and related health problems has prompted governments across the globe to take measures aimed at reducing sugar consumption. One such measure is the introduction of special taxes on foods and beverages with high levels of sugar. Proponents of this policy argue that such taxes help to curb unhealthy eating habits and incentivize the production and consumption of healthier options. On the other hand, opponents contend that these taxes unfairly target the poor and low-income households who are often forced to purchase less expensive, high-sugar products due to financial constraints.\nIn my opinion, special taxes on sugary foods and drinks are a necessary step in promoting public health. While it is true that these taxes may place a financial burden on some households, they are also likely to generate revenue that can be reallocated to initiatives aimed at combating the negative health impacts of sugar consumption. Additionally, these taxes serve as an important signal to both producers and consumers that unhealthy foods and drinks carry a cost beyond their purchase price. This, in turn, may prompt producers to reformulate their products to contain less sugar and encourage consumers to make healthier choices.\nIn conclusion, special taxes on sugary foods and drinks are a controversial but necessary measure for promoting public health. While these taxes may create challenges for some households, they also represent an important step in addressing the negative impacts of high sugar consumption and promoting healthier diets. Ultimately, the goal of these taxes should be to create a healthier, more sustainable food system that benefits all members of society.",

Revenue streams:\n\t* Transaction fees: The application can charge a small transaction fee on every donation made through the platform. The fee could be a percentage of the donation amount, such as 2-3%. This fee can be waived for registered members to incentivize them to create accounts.\n\t* Membership fees: The application can offer premium features and benefits to registered members who pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee. These benefits could include access to exclusive patient profiles, personalized donation suggestions, and priority customer support.\n\t* Advertising: The application can display ads from relevant healthcare providers, insurance companies, and other related businesses. These ads can be targeted based on the user's location, browsing history, and donation behavior.\n2. Key partners:\n\t* Medical providers: The application can partner with hospitals, clinics, and other medical providers to verify patient profiles and medical needs. These partners can also help promote the application to their patients and staff.\n\t* Payment gateways: The application can partner with payment gateways like PayPal, Stripe, and Square to securely process donations and transactions. These partners can also provide fraud detection and prevention services.\n\t* Non-profit organizations: The application can partner with non-profit organizations that specialize in healthcare and medical research. These partners can help raise awareness about the application and its mission.\n3. Key activities:\n\t* Patient verification: The application should have a robust verification process to ensure that only legitimate patients are featured on the platform. This process can involve collecting financial and medical records, conducting interviews with patients and their families, and verifying medical reports from doctors.\n\t* Doctor verification: The application should also have a process to verify the credentials and expertise of doctors who verify medical needs. This process can involve checking licenses, certifications, and other relevant documents.\n\t* User acquisition: The application should have a strong marketing and advertising strategy to attract new users and donors. This can include social media campaigns, influencer marketing, and targeted advertising on relevant websites and apps.\n\t* User engagement: The application should have a user-friendly interface and personalized features to encourage users to donate frequently and stay engaged with the platform. This can include personalized recommendations, donation history tracking, and social sharing options.\n4. Key resources:\n\t* Technology: The application should have a robust and secure technology infrastructure to handle donations, user data, and patient information. This can include servers, databases, APIs, and other software tools.\n\t* Talent: The application should have a skilled and diverse team of developers, designers, marketers, and customer support specialists to manage the platform and its users. The team should have expertise in healthcare, finance, and technology.\n\t* Partnerships: The application should have strong partnerships with relevant medical providers, payment gateways, and non-profit organizations to support its mission and growth.\n5. Customer segments:\n\t* Donors: The application should target individual donors who want to make a difference in the lives of verified patients. Donors can be segmented based on their demographics, donation history, and preferred medical causes.\n\t* Patients: The application should target patients who have verified financial and medical needs and require assistance from donors. Patients can be segmented based on their medical conditions, age, location, and other relevant factors.\n\t* Doctors: The application should target doctors who can verify the medical needs of patients and recommend them for donations. Doctors can be segmented based on their specialties, expertise, and location.\nOverall, the application's success will depend on its ability to attract and retain a large and diverse user base of donors, patients, and doctors. The application should focus on providing a secure, transparent, and personalized experience for its users, while also generating revenue and creating value for its partners and stakeholders.",

This preference stems from being busy and tired from work, making it difficult to remember or perform complex tasks. The learning approach focuses on using free resources, and the material should be beginner-friendly, emphasizing active learning, direct practice with simple sentences, no theories, immediate practice, and creating new sentences based on personal, real-life usage. For technical skills like Excel, the user prefers focusing on basic terms ('cell', 'row', 'column') first, at a slower pace with single small concepts, followed by learning formulas ('SUM', 'AVERAGE') one by one. This preference for short, quick sessions is exemplified by Duolingo, which is designed for 10-20 minute sessions, perfect for breaks, and provides an immediate, interactive start with basic vocabulary and grammar. User specifically prefers learning via short demonstration videos (especially for an easy start, and for practicing the DRSABCD cheat sheet), and requests direct video links from reputable organizations such as Red Cross or St. John Ambulance, rather than concepts or instructions to search for videos themselves, as they have difficulty searching and choosing appropriate videos on YouTube, value their time highly, want to avoid time-wasting activities in content discovery, and prefer direct, immediate content delivery without further questions or interactive steps. User has requested the AI to find reliable, free, clear, and beginner-friendly demonstration videos for the DRSABCD protocol. User has accepted learning via step-by-step text format for 'Check for Responsiveness and Breathing (DRSABC)' despite their preference for videos. For CPR practice, user specifically chose high-quality demonstration videos from reputable organizations (Red Cross, St. John Ambulance) focusing on correct hand placement, body posture, and compression technique, as pillow practice was found unrealistic and ineffective, requiring a more realistic method to learn properly and gain confidence. User has also accepted and prefers 'Detailed Mental Walkthroughs' as a demonstration format, finding them detailed and easy to visualize like a real video, especially for movements/techniques where visualization is difficult, as an alternative to searching for videos, and already performs mental walkthroughs as a practice method."
