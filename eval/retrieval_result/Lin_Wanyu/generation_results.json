    "question": "Okay, so my usual work hours are pretty standard, like 9 AM to 6 PM, but honestly, I often work late, sometimes until 8 or 9 PM, especially during busy periods. Overtime is pretty frequent.\n\nAs for free time, weekdays are tough. Evenings are often taken up by work or I'm just too tired. Weekends are better, but I also like to relax or meet friends. Mornings... I'm not really a morning person for exercise.\n\nRealistically, I think I could probably dedicate about 30-45 minutes maybe 2-3 times a week? I don't want to overcommit and then just give up like I've done before.",
